I don't care if you see that as immature.
 The value of the Chroma's are simply not 5 dollars.
 It's not a lot of money, and that's why it's being bought.
 But if you actually think about it, it's not worth the money, and people that do not play this game have all agreed.
 They laugh at the quality of the recolors and the price.
But because you guys enjoy this game so much, you'd buy anything really.
When normal people with no skill in photoshop create a chroma pack with even more colors, and the same if not higher quality, then that's a problem.
 And any person who isn't biased would agree.
If I make a drawing which is garbage, but people buy it, doesn't mean that's the worth of it.
 Because I bet you if the price would have been lower, more people would buy it.

drug addiction, flaming, alcoholism, are all lack of self-control.
 They are the same category other than a few chemicals in some drugs.
>Self control should be all you need to play an online game
If people had self-control, then we wouldn't need tribunal.
 People get banned, they make or buy new accounts, and they continue flaming.
Why are you so passionate about stopping good ideas from getting to reddit's front page?
 Let riot see it, let them decide about it.
 It's a good idea.
 **It has the potential to stop a lot of flamers in their tracks**.
 People, even little kids, get bullied everyday on league and parents can control that with such an option.
I see people flaming in EVERY LOSING ranked game.
 It's human nature.
 The way to combat it is to give people a way not to get involved.
well i dont ping 35 times.
.
 but 2-4 is reasonable if you want to make sure evryone sees it
the only exception is the missing ping because i like to ping out paths i saw the enemy take for example a midlaner roams bot i dont only ping miss but i ping down the river or something
also i like spamming the missing ping on my mate when he does something rly stupid.

Ay, Portland represent!

 Value and cost are subjective.
 To me (and probably to a few others), the skin has some value and the cost is negligible.
 You are welcome to have your own perception of ‘worth’, and so are we.
Nouise.
What about ashe's Volley and MF's W?
I think that's true but probably the average here is slightly higher then the average of all players since players here have shown enough interest to search out other sources of info 
NA spends $5 no matter what since we don't have a $2.
50 option.
 I can understand the EU players being upset I guess, but really for NA it doesn't matter unless you were trying to spend no money and just use extra RP.
 As we all know Riot is an US company first when it comes to prices.
Please, this would be huge actually.
One thing I think we'd all like, but of course, we wouldn't agree on if we thought about it from their side, is RP discounts on (certain) skins if we already have a skin for that champion.
 On my main, I bought can decent skin, but not great skin, on most champs when they came on sale because they were just funner than base skins.
 For example, Fizz, I have one of his skins, but damn.
 a simple recolor of his base skin to red is by far my favorite now.
 I discount for what would be my main skin for Fizz would be nice.
 You can argue that's what refunds are for, but we only get 3 period.
 Even instead of an RP discount, an option unlocked for IP if we have x amount of skins already owned for a certain champion would be cool for chromas.
 RP discount on new skins if we have x number of skins already for a champion would be nice.
 Whatever the discount, whatever the amount of skins we own for a certain champ can be determined later.
 I'm just saying it would be a nice feature.
 The discounts don't have to be extreme, and with sales not being as good as they were, I feel like it's only a balance to the "price inflation" we've been seeing.
 From the business side of things, it may not even be a loss.
 It can result in more profits.
 It can result in more people buying skins that make up for the negative price difference.
 Food for thought.
 Bye bye.
IMO it is not viable.

The machete upgrade's aren't great ( Challenging smite is actually good for a top laner.

Dude hardly any pros flame their own teammates when they lose, people flame in solo queue but that's because they are used to a higher level of play and when people go full retard they rage
Why the condescending tone?
 You didn't think about how hilariously hypocritical that is?
Gambit manager gonna ruin whole organisation, team clearly only needs new ad carry and exp midlaner if they wanna try to get to worlds, if not just new ad and keep betsy to get exp.

What are you basing picking up pobelter on?
 Its clearly not his performance based on the fact that if he preformed well he wouldnt be in this spot in the firstplace.
 Most teams want someone who still is able to prove they are a good player, opposed to someone who has had a large ammount of time to prove so playing at a high level and has proved to be mediocre at best.

Judging by your comment history, you've got a long way to go yourself, youngster.
THe one without name stacks with different items the one with the same name different items doesn't stack.
 Like rage from page and rage from black cleaver.
 or lichbane/Gauntlet/Spell blade Sheen does not stack.
It is supposed to be like that, made a post about this too a month ago or so but working as intended.
LOL, maybe i should have worded the title differenly but thanks for the response!
i am still not entirely convinced but hype potential is a thing on reddit i will give you that
I'm not talking about his person or his identity, I'm talking about the name Faker being used as a meme at this point.
 There's a difference between knowing who he is and having heard his name before, I'm strictly talking about the latter, you're talking abiut the former.
So gilius is the new saint?
Yet you go ahead and release them for RP.
You totally do agree with us.
I will just paste my comment above here since it seems like you haven't seen it.
 I think it's a pretty good response to what you said and why I think it's wrong and this move is a risky one.
I have no doubt that Rekkless is a way better player than Steelback will ever be and I know that Steelback is just a role player and he will never be a star.
However, that's the whole point about ruining Fnatic's team Dynamic.
 Yellowstar plays a heavy roaming style right now, because leaving Steelback and roaming around to help Febiven, setting up vision and even going top for ganks is not an issue.
 Steelback is not the main carry of the team so if he loses some farm in the process it is no problem.
Fnatic right now is also a Top and mid focused team.
 Huni and Febiven do most of the heavy lifting and they are the members who get more attention from Reignover.
Lastly, Fnatic loves to fight.
 They play a risky fighting style where at any point in the game they might start forcing team fights or skirmishes all around the map.
Now going back to Rekkless, he will demand more farm, he is so passive early game and does not want to come for fights and he wants jungler attention.
 I don't wanna make this already long comment any longer so I guess these points can help you understand why getting Rekkless is not really the smartest idea and why it might ruin their team dynamic.
Yup importing should just be for teams like fnatic.
 You never say shit when it is a team from China getting players or even the team whose flair you throw up.
What do you mean?
 I'm going to take a swing in the dark and guess you're asking why people build Haunting Guise/Sorc Shoes or Abyssal/Sorc Shoes and that is because most ranged champs have 30 base MR so you can deal true damage.
Any ~~"Escape from.

I thought Rito said that Chromas were going to be part of the mastery thing once it releases, and that they released it early for RP for reasons I don't remember.
Hes also produces some of the most insightful and interesting content for league.
 You can hate his personality and comments, but his content is an asset to the league of legends community for sure.
Back then I wanted Rekkles to stay.
 Now I want Steelback to stay.
 Nobody wants judas back
I gess its time to edward:
1- go russia and be the support
2- retire
still one month on the main and the last game was urf that is more than dubios tbh.
Show me one active pro who was inactive on his main for so long
Yep, got nerfed.
 In a anti-fun and boring way.
I think that, apart from allowing it to be interrupted, I think that they should also increase its cooldown a little bit and reduce its range.
The game is broken.
 The mark/dash was too much.
 It's now a gimmick mode that isn't fun.
 I hope this doesn't stick around, aram is mostly all I play (not a aram only account, i own a zillion champs)
If it stays like this i can't say i play much more lol :-/

if they get altec and another na midlaner, tdk could become an actual na team.
 instead of a korean team which plays in na.
its very possible
Faker has maintained a 100% competitive win rate on a few champions main one being leblanc (ezreal too I think) even while his team was playing piss poor.
 im not saying you are completely wrong either, "talent" may not always equal success but it sure does help.
I'm basically trying to say that while they may be braking up their winning roster I do think rekkles is much better than steelback and yellowstar and rekkles were a dominant bot lane.
 If fnatic wants to play better internationally I think its the right risk to take because bot lane was their weakest point.
Aa needs 2 offensive items to function optimally, but he doesn't make enough impact with it and he doesn't offer much else without offensive items.
For me, Aa is competing for a similar slot as Jax, who is much stronger with 2 offensive items.

One thing to note is that they have preemptively nerfed her attack speed growth per level in lieu of her reworked kit.
 However she'll probably still be in a decent spot, seeing that her Q gives her a respectable amount of attack speed.
i love life
it helps with toggle so you don't accidentally take tower agro if you are pushing.
 If you look at some LCS games, they toggle it off for this reason.
Seems like a bunch of whining kids.
 I'm going to buy all of them for both my accounts just to piss them off.
Yeah, i played 2 arams , both losses and the people were salty in the game and i got hit by a 75 game chat restrict.
.
I know that its only of those 2 games because i didn't get ranked restricted, only chat(if u get reported in normal games), and i only had those 2 normal games and the rest was ranked.
If all it takes is some reports in 2 games to get 75 chat restrict, i'd rather have tribunal back, atleast that was a little bit more fair judgement.
H2K wasn't really a random group of people though, and neither really was Fnatic considering 3/5 players were either in the challenger scene or on an LCS/OGN team.
 EU is incredibly inconsistent anyway so I don't know what to even make of it.
Well the only meaningful place CLG can go is if they get 1st place in the LCS because chances are that's the only way they would get to World's.
 So if they can't achieve that then yes there's really no point to changing their roster.
 That's the only way their team matters in this scenario.
 It's better to have people stick together that believe in one another rather than just get a bunch of randoms together (especially from NA) on short notice.
 The risk is relegation vs the chance of going to worlds and if you were the team manager the choice would just be incredibly obvious.
I have no idea how you got to what you just wrote, but uh.
 it's interesting I suppose.
Not at first (december 2013), then "sorry it's a bug we fixed it" (Jan 2014), and "well fear is RNG, so instead of fixing the biggest RNG in the game (crit), let's try to break Fiddle" (feb 2014)

- **Server:** NA
- **Type of Bug:** Client
- **Description:** The client is really messed up, not just for me, but for plenty of other people I'm getting matched with.
 Chats to friends/to a premade party don't go through (for me, or for them, and generally it'll be the same area that's not going through.
 Either one, or the other, or even both won't work.
 As well, the rune page is messed up, and it was fine back in 5.
7, so I'm inclined to believe 5.
8 broke it.
 I restarted the client twice to make sure it wasn't a system error (it wasn't).
 Scroll bars don't work (you click on them, they disappear), and you can't switch rune pages.
 Champion tab doesn't work either, it's just blank.
 Same with spells.
 Item sets don't work, there's just all of the item names smushed together with no item pages.
- **Video / Screenshot:** [Here](http://i.
imgur.
com/dCHRkbU.
jpg) and [here](http://i.
imgur.
com/NBui2X0.
png)
- **Steps to reproduce:** Open the client, browse to the rune page, or try to talk to your friends.
- **Expected result:** Runes look normal and organized, and you can talk to friends like you could before.
 You can also go and read up on champs and spells, and create item sets.
- **Observed result:** Runes look like [this] (http://i.
imgur.
com/dCHRkbU.
jpg) and chat messages won't go through from either end.
 Champs and spells look like [this](http://i.
imgur.
com/NBui2X0.
png), same with item sets.
- **Reproduction rate:** Thus far, 75%.
 Not sure what caused this, but my 4th restart is working fine.
- **System specs:** AMD FX-8320, Windows 7, AMD HD 7850, 2 week old AMD catalyst driver, and 8 gb of ram.
 Other people than me have the same issue too though, so I doubt it's my end that's the problem.
Forgiven and Monte both agreed the only two ADC's in EU who have a case for being better than him were forgiven and freeze, so there's that as well.
I just wanted to lie on the internet.
 Never went this deep before.
 Glad I was appropriately downvoted oddly enough.
 Shows the system working :') 
eidt: vape adventures AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
The only change it needs is a slightly longer cooldown.
 Making it have a cooldown like flash or heal is far too long.
 Maybe they could try doubling the cooldown and seeing how that works out?
Edit: Poke champs are far more disruptive to ARAM than this SS will probably ever be.
I beat a poke comp with melees all running mark due to being squishy and us having good cc we could burst people down ridiculously fast.
EDIT also we were pretty tanky.
Or eu in na
Champions with instant cast CC got too strong, Alistar is a beast with this new summoner.
> But his impact was negligible on almost any champion
Someone only remembers a few of Vulcuns games rather than their year of play before the swap.
 Zuna carried them to playoffs solo in the first split of LCS with his Tristana and was a major factor in many of their summer split wins.
 Yeah he played a very aggressive style and got punished for it when he made mistakes but that doesn't make him a bad player.
 He was magnitudes better than anyone ever gives him credit for.
Also important in terms of the role swap from Zuna/Xmithie is that **BOTH** players had played the other roles before.
 Xmithie was an ADC early on in his career, and Zuna was a jungler, and Zuna was the shot caller, and shot calling is much harder from the ADC role.
 Nothing about that move was wrong.
 What was wrong was that they decided to do it 2 weeks before the season started and they didn't play any soloqueue to practice their new roles because that team was a bunch of lazy idiots after worlds.
 They were fated to be relegated role swap or no because they had completely stopped giving a shit.
That's a bingo!
Not Nyph but Promiscuous.
Hai stepped down for medical reasons.
 He literally **couldn't** play the amount needed because of his wrists, and trying to do so could really ruin his life with bad wrists/hands.
 Hai didn't step down because it was best for the team.
 Hai didn't step down because he wasn't good enough.
 Hai stepped down because his body was at its breaking point, and he had to make the tough call of one more split of glory (and likely be ruined for worlds anyhow) or move on in his life and save his hands.
Lol.
 Dw, I have sense
I don't see a new player like Noxiak lie about something like this.
I was also using Debonair Jayce, and i had the same problem.
Why is this being down voted, I'm from kuwait and been here 18 years, this is 100% true.
So you're saying people can change!
?
 Preposterous.
:)
He outlaned bjerg once, lost once in a bad matchup, 1 game got snowballed on because he got 3 man ganked,and the rest of the games went even and did very well throughout the game.
 Against shiphtur and huhi, good players in their own right, he was described as dominating.
I think it should be purchasable, but reusable in all future splits.
 For example, my 2014 TSM summoner icon isn't going anywhere, so if I buy, for example, a TSM ward, I don't want it to go anywhere either.
I just tested this in game.
 It appears that the animation completes as normal but the damage doesn't apply till after the animation is already complete.
 Using it to cancel autos is counterproductive since the damage actually doesn't apply to the Q instance till after its finished.
 Its inconsistent though.
 Sometimes it applies the damage right away, as soon as talons blade hits the target, other times it takes a full quarter second or so to apply after it hits.
 I can't reproduce it with reliability, but it happens more than half the times.
Gotta read up on your Zelda lore, yo.

She didn't contribute anything intelligent though.
 She just said parts of Lux should be like other champs without justification 
its better now
Im laughing that people think this hurt aram smurfs, if anything it made them stronger, the only squishied that can do anything are the super op poke champs, any average mage/ads get crushed by engage champs.
The non engage melee still suck cause they just get stunned/ccd after porting, its boosted engage tanks/bruisers that were already VERY strong in aram like galio/ali etc.
Theres probably less viable champs now.
(Pssst, it was a joke)

are you KIDDING, shes SO good now, playing her on pbe, oh my god, that ult damage
note, (dragon form) she still has the AOE E, still leaves a trail with W
she lost her (stoppable) jump for a short INVULNERABLE jump which then creates a ring around her that deals the most disgusting true damage dot ive ever seen
its balanced because theres absolutly nothing (in her kit) that forces them to walk in, but at the same time theyre now forced to 1v1 a very strong 1v1 champion, or instantly die to the ring
you can also use it as zoning tool, you dont wanna walk into that as i keep repeating
Bah!

Wang Sicong's father has publicly expressed his disappointment in his son.
 I don't think Wang Sicong has much say in what Dalian Wanda Group does.
That's a strawman argument.
 You've tried that a few times, actually.
I *love* hearing people's opinions.
 There are (or should be, rather) two winners in a debate:
1.
 The person who is proven 'correct' against the opposition and impacts the third-party observers in a (preferably) positive fashion and,
2.
 The person who learns most from the subject matter and has a clear opportunity to change.
Or, it could be a compromise from both sides where both learn and they reach a middle-ground.
 A clashing of opposing opinions is **brilliant** for development.
However, that doesn't make every opinion a 'fantastic learning experience' and I'd argue that yours really isn't.
 You were looking for a justification for yours and others' entitlement and I had none of it.
 You can try to explain why I'm wrong instead of saying whatever about how I am, because I do not care for your opinion of me, and you shouldn't care for my opinion of you.
 I care for your perspective and reasoning.
You didn't provide much that helped me, though, and you think that by being blunt in my argument against someone who visibly insinuated a negative approach towards a large group of people purely because of a difference of opinion, I am the one who doesn't like people who voice their opinions?
I suppose you're right to an extent.
 I don't like people voicing *only* their opinions.
I'd like reasons, too.
I mean, OP tried to give reasons.
 I don't know if you did; like I'd pointed out, you appeared to argue against a bunch of things that I'd never even said.
 But OP's demeanour was poor and his explanation unfit for a fair perspective.
 Honestly; voting with wallets is fine.
 Judging Riot's decision making in a condescending fashion and heralding those who align with them negatively, though?
No thanks.
 That's not worth being seen as 'voicing an opinion', that's just being crude.
If you mean have it as an option for not seeing toxicity, type /mute all at the beginning of a game, that exists.
 Its just Riots stance on the issue, if you're not banned they'll give you a chance with a few messages, or for any absolutely necessary communication like summoner spells.
 If you're bad enough they don't trust you at all its just a ban.
Newbies playing it isn't a good argument.
I like the idea of voting with my wallet, but saying it should be free sounds entitled
What's to laugh about?
 They're an old org, and they're well established at showing promise at the start of the split and then collapsing into a wreck for the second half and playoffs.

Who the fuck is Yasou?
SAUCE!
?
I don't think they realize how big of a game league is.
 They see 600k~ summoners and think they're over half the player base when they're not even close to a tenth lol.
Mark/Dash is completely stupid.
 It wasn't my problem before if the toddler my teammates apparently subbed in for themselves couldn't dodge spears, but now Malphite just has to hit one teammate with a snowball and he's on me.
 There's no way to outposition it.
 You just have to pray your team doesn't take it to the face once too often.
a dream can be manly
lol nice.
 it actually has a nice ring to hit, gave me a good laugh.
I like this way more
preACH
First 75% of the video - Ok this better be good.
Last 25% of the video - Holy shit that was gorgeous and exceeded all expectations.
This is worth money for me.
 I don't think they should be free because I place value in the character's look customization.
 After all, that's basically all we pay for in this 'free' game 
wellwellwell, If it isnt KevinCaution.
 Yeah, I know who you are.
 mYou're the one that said my post was too long.
 Too Long!
 well, now here I am, waiting for my moment to strike.
 Whenever you think that you are safe from an extremely long post I'll be there.
 You have Complained once to many and now I'll bring the shitstorm.
 I have over 50 (fifty) posts that you would consider needing a teal deer at the end, but I shall always deny you that simple request.
 Even now, my fingers grow stronger at the brush of the keys, they quiver in anticipation at where you will post next, always waiting for a retort to your demands.
 And as you rage at your screen, not content in the shortness of the post, I will be at my Station, quietly laughing.
great story.
 So why is the system broken?
I didnt downvote you but you dont really know soaz then.
 He is not like 99% of the toplaners that play calculated or by some sort of book that guy only listens to his instinct and he has a huge talent so it goes really well for him.
 While it can be seen as a hinderniss it is also one of his biggest strenghts because he is practically unpredictable.
YES
BUT RITO CLIENT PLS /s
nothing in Wisconsin :( nobody likes League in the frozen tundra.
This post is awful 
I think the Chromas are super cool.
 I just wish the Leona one was for the superior Leona skin.
Iron Solari Leona is really good but I'd love it in other colors, too.
r U a farmer
championsuggest: na steamed buns
doesnt that make the skt ward less valuable since it was for winning world championship
Broken and Nintendudex used to be co hosts on a certain talk show for league.
 Could just be that
Life is.
 One's journey through life.
awful enough to respond to i see
Steelback said in an interview that they're very good friends, I was just guessing.
.
 :( Why did he deactivated his ask?
I honestly dont know why people should pay for chroma packs, legit would be to implement chroma packs into upcoming champion mastery feature.
 or at least had chromas ready far far backwards when u started selling skins and make it so that player who will buy skin can choose from classic and those chroma skins colours WHEN HE BUYS THE SKIN, not to make them pay for skin and 2 years later come up with different colours for those skins and if u want those pay more.
I own many skins and still have no idea why i should pay for them again if i want them in slighty different color, this option should be for IP or as an achievment in champion mastery if you want to make this feature go live, if u want it for RP than it should cost like 100 RP and even that would make me doubt buying them, because to be honest they are not even that special u just took skin and changed primary color.
BTW for chromas of real skins (those u have to buy) u have to pay for skins and then for chromas so it basicly costs same as legendary skins, which i believe provides new voice over, different skill colors, animations, maybe even more i dont know and chroma skins are the same skin for example Dragon Fist Lee sin everything is same but his outfit is black :D and it costs 1565 RP legendaries are 1820 RP for comparison and yes i know legendaries can get chromas too but thats not the point of what i am trying to show here.
Sorry for bad english its not my native language, but i think people can understand what i am trying to say.
and now they are in LSPL.
Yeah, we randomly found out when we played Nami and Varus in a game and noticed how strange but awesome the E looks.
 Time to play it more often!
HotS isn't LoL's competition at all LOL.
 And the difference here is HotS is owned by Blizzard.
 A company with.
5 VERY popular games out right now?
 WoW, D3, Starcraft 2, Hearthstone and HotS.
 They can afford to give shit out for free because they already have so much money coming in elsewhere.
 Sure, you could argue Riot does too but Riot also needs money regardless.
 Especially since it's their ONLY game.
 Makes perfect sense to offer a little something like this for RP.
The Plank 
Sure, ideally a new mid will come in and be Faker while also having the best shot calling in the world.
.
but people over estimate this shit too.
 People act like Hai was the only person on C9 that had any clue what they should do.
I think all the players have an idea of what and when they should do things and it won't be very hard for someone to say so during a game.
Where does it come from that C9 has some brotherly cohesion with Yusui?
?
?
 They played 2 weeks of scrims with him?
 LOL?
This shit is retarded.
 I swear people just watch these guys stream and like their personalities and then can't get off their dicks.
.
Doesn't have anything to do with how they actually play as long as they can make a meme in Twitch chat over and over again 9999999 times and still thinking it's funny.
Yup challenging smite.
 My mistake
Well, I know you are not being serious, but still the player would have to either be from denmark or UK.
Our team tried that and it still didn't work, all we could do was sit and watch our towers go down.
 Still no champions after reconnecting
:') Gotta believe in the thirst

Night hunter Rengar (first rp champ, gotta show respect)
Dude, i gifted him a mystery skin and he actually put it in his video.
 You CAN buy happiness!
Bjerg is the best mid in the west.
I prefer LSI because it works like the spectator client, so you can move the screen around and look other places.
 See what happened outside of your screen.
is that the old minion?
I'll check on the shield!
Agreed, OP just sounds like he really wants the chromas to fail so Riot will start giving them out for free.
Wait you decline Elements but tryout for Giants?
To be fair, they affect different things.
 The BotRK/BC changes will probably make dealing with tanks a little easier, but at the same time, maybe they thought tanks damage output was too high.
 That's what this Cinderhulk change is aimed at.
My favorite part about this argument is that whenever a team puts up an art contest for someone to design a logo, with the sole reward being exposure, people flock to the discussion up in arms about how making artists work for free is unethical.
Twist it around and now ethics don't matter.
there is a clue in his answer: "The best feeling to remember that you look like **a** sperm.
" I don't know about you guys, but I don't see myself having "a" sperm.
lol.
.
 gg, i remember reading about bard cant self cast one of his spell either
That's called Deadly Kennen and it already exists as a skin.
this isn't a bug, in the chroma packs announcement it says they won't be available in team builder at first.
He plays in challenger
but the point remains is that he has a lot more contact with the people in the pro scene than any in this post
ive seen more games carried by annie mid than most of the champions this subreddit complains about.
i don't know how she does it, but she seems to leave lane with double kills and triple kills and 10/0 no matter what happens
So what does this do to cinderhulk?
 Is it a nerf or what?
He was playing the best wave clear champ in the game.
 While using mega death bomb to get cs in other lanes.
Dude come on 
Not everything is sexism
Her being a woman had literally nothing to do with it
People still harp on monte cristo and thoorin in threads about old shit and from what I can see they are men 
It would be if Aatrox had a good AoE damage follow up.
Unfortunately, he is mostly AA based.
 That is his main problem in teamfights, he is AA based and he cannot stick to a target long enough to do damage.
Because C9 went with new talent, while others just seem to go with oldies.
 Xmithie back, challenger teams always using Lattman and such.
.
 Like noone new comes in challenger or anything.
.
That's hilarious
Oh come on, how do the chroma skins break "game clarity" any more then normal skins?
Guess I'll wait until they cost IP.
The better player sure, but even the best players isn't enough sometimes.
 Steelback showed us he was good enough, and he can get better.
Rekkles for all I know fucks his organizations over.
 Being a emotional kid inside and outside the game.
 How is that a better choice for Fnatic?
 Only time will tell if it was the right choice.
 I still wish the best for Steelback.
He was being used in the same way.
 A consistent poke champion that sieges well.
 Doesn't matter where you play him lol.
Oh genja.
.
 The builds
[lol](http://gifrific.

For the time being put 2 or 3 earlier points into black shield.
dragon's rage > dragon's descent
I am all for the sexy chromas, as far as recolors go they look much better then most.
 normally just shitty hue changes.
 I do think they should cost less.
 but buying with RP is ok in my mind.
I WANT FUCKING ZAC CHROMAS, DO YOU HEAR ME RIOT!
?
 ZAC FUCKING CHROMAS!
!
!
uhm, Trist players were actually rushing Shiv, not IE.
Were you dead when you checked it?
 the same thing happens with devourer.
 It usually calcualtes from you bonus health but if you're dead it wont do it.
GJ deleting all of your comments bro and then when you cant argue with someone you just call them names.
 You are the reason why people hate TSM fans :\^)
oh yeah not knocking it, its great, getting to play videogames for your income, not too bad, even the bad days id imagine are far better than a decent day anywhere else, but to each their own, I've heard stories of pro gamers who wouldnt wish their fate on others.
 there was one who told his younger brother not to go pro because its jsut too stressful and time consuming.
he hasnt played in a long time
You owe me a 10 second car.

Even better, just let them jump on you first.
 That way they have nothing up and they're right next to you.

 My b.
Yeah I'm not paying for stupid color packs.
 Those things are the price of a good meal for me.
 Can't really afford that on a college budget.
I love these team wards!
 Not buying them if they disappear though.
 I like the two ideas presented with the LCS ward slot.
 Seems reasonable.
;-;
http://i.
imgur.
com/nO9akg4.

i want it removed, but for different reasons
I'll say
Ok, my initial 3 opinions are.
1.
) That would be a super cool way to support multiple teams.
2.
) Hmmm, not really a fan of buying something that will disappear.
 Old icons don't, don't really see why wards should.
3.
) Could be a foothold for advertisement.
 Wouldn't be a fan of seeing TSM logo in the mid lane or Coke Zero written in the bushes in top lane.
It's better to have a summoner spell like exauhst so you can get early kills or snub early aggression.
At this point I wonder if he's just leaking everything to advertise his stream >.
>
Just warn people you're trying something new in the lobby.
 If they care that much they'll dodge.
 I personally like having an off-the-wall pick on my team so I can blame someone else if I'm losing.
I like how Shiphtur lost.
> But the difference?
 Players in other sports aren't going on reddit and reading posts about themselves (if you want to use basketball players who are 18ish in the NBA).
Teams like TSM ban their players from reading reddit for a reason.
 If social media isn't helping you, if your fanbase is nonexistent, don't bother logging into twitter or facebook to view death threats and people calling you trash.
>They have years and years of professional experience around them, trainers and players and coaches and all of these people that, should someone actually get down from what they're saying, there's an entire support staff around them.
 Sports psychologists and everything.
MOst LCS teams are already at this level though!
 LXGG, specifically, is on a team with Seraph, who had terrible nerve issues and issues facing the community.
 People still have the same tools to deal with these problems.
>That player isn't in your living room hearing you say it.
 This player could be on reddit reading it.
Lol people in Philly chant "EAGLES" when the Phillies aren't doing good.
 Live crowd fans can be just as brutal as reddit.
>You're making my point.
Not really.
 I'm pointing out that while people shouldn't say it, that it is going to happen and realistically, players need to learn how to deal with it.
 Without doing that, players are going to constantly cave to trolls and pressure.
And don't think that the community alone brings about this pressure, management can as well.
 Don't deceive yourself into LXGG not thinking this wouldn't happen.
 Don't believe some naive fairy-tale land where subjectively low skilled players like LXGG are entirely under the illusion that they are WX reincarnated and they will entirely change the meta of League as we know it.
Better than getting the starting rooster.
> It is still only the opinion of outraged idiots with the motivation to go on twitter and have the lack of self awareness to understand how crazy their shit is.
 It is not a mass of the community and I bet more people cringe at those comments then support them.
It's funny, you could say the same thing about pretty much everything posted on this subreddit, yet people still act like it's a majority of the community and that our opinions matter.
And it's intended.
At the very least, they've lived in America since 2009 (When HoN teams first started), so they're not really korean imports.
WHP/Loaded/EG for life.
Lol you think this will work?
 12 year olds buy what they want they don't care about the company.
 The majority of LoL players are little shits.

 He believes that there might be another release for Split 2 with the new teams icons, but not sure if/when that would happen.
 Hope this helps.
MM
yes, dexter, that guy that made nukeduck look like the best mid eu, yes, that jungler guy who was in the highest finishing clg lineup since 2012, yes, really, dexter
Yep, that's the thing with chaos.
 It was god damn time EU scene experience it first hand.
 Just like NA with LMQ last year.
Because, seriously, when that shit happen for you for the first time at world when you play a chineese team, that's not really the good moment to learn how to deal with it.
If Steeelback + Yellowstar can't 2v2 well, they don't even have a chance of getting out of the group stage at MSI.
Except Genja is an ADC not a fucking midlaner.
 Both Shiptur and Bjergsen were playing him and even if Genja did it first that doesn't mean POE did nothing to make Varus look strong.
I don't know what you said in game, but the butthole comment was rude.
>People thought they were worth
People are suckers for skins and Riot could price them at 2k and people would keep saying they are worth it.
They even said that the majority of people do not buy their shit.
 It's a small minority of idiots who ruins it for everyone by throwing their money for this.
muh free market
j4 E+Q
So you're one of those people who said to "just dodge" old AP nid spears?
 You cant dodge everything.

incarnati0n has never played an lcs game how can you make that claim LOL

I am just sitting here .
 waiting for a chess/card-themed azir skin .
the technology just isnt there yet.
ya alot of nay say and no actual ideas.
.
 but what do u expect
It's utterly depressing realizing that Dunkey is a better play than me and it still took him five tries to get through his gold promos.
are there any more champs that use the auto attack projectiles for their skills?
and i wonder about the ashe Q after the rework, maybe it will also be like that
Like yeah, but I also want something better for Lucian.
 There's room for development there and I don't want something great to be put off because he gets a subpar 750 RP skin, ya feel?
>worst ADC
Is she actually worse than Quinn, MF, Ashe in a TANK meta?
 lol
Dare I ask for the link please?
Intended.
championsuggest: na GabriellaElise
It's because his first comment was that trist was garbage, and then he got beat in a match against her and changed his mind.
Same with Lucian when he was first picked up in LCS.
 Doublelift said Lucian sucked, and then it became 100% pick/ban.
Pretty sure he said that about kali as well, but that one I can't honestly remember.
Now I know how dlift held his ground at LCS for so long.
 He's the true entertainer.
 Gotta love him making a fool of himself over and over and over keke
Lots of people are buying them however, me included.
 I like them and they're not really over priced if you have a job.
Not only that, we would not have watched the glorious games when najin got dumpstered.
 lol.
r we part of NA?
As someone who loves playing Kennen and likes pokemon at the same time.
 this needs to happen!
Yeah everyone already said it Lucian, sivir, kalista and Kog maw if they don't have a dive heavy team comp where youll get gang raped every two seconds.
I don't see why an up & coming journalist like Jacob Wolf would lie about something like that.
He actually has a lot more to lose by lying than Noxiak, given the global misstrust of this community regarding journalists and their capactity to totally ignore the bullshit / lies players & org.

mind = blown
Guys come on, the easiest answer to this dilema is to simply make the chromas purchasable through RP and IP in this way players will be able to get their chroma skins without necessarily having to pay.
 Lets face it, riot is a f2p company and needs the income, thus chromas should also be purchasable through RP.
 There will always be someone willing to spend cash and those that do not want to, will only have to grind a bit.
 I think this is the most logical decision if riot is unwilling to make chromas free
Your point is completely irrelevant.
 A player doesn't make a team.
 Altec is obviously a better adc.
That's my [headcannon](http://daddius.
deviantart.
com/art/One-Piece-Franky-420552035) for Kha.
 He can fly and such just fine, but there are limitations on him due to the League (when it was run by the institute of War it was a rule, now it's just.
 due to.
 magic pollution or something around the Rift?
).
 Also Kog'maw's Artillery is like an actual artillery, can fire several miles.
thooorin, irelia stomps shyvanna.
he was flying to na tomarrow
Bring me my cape of suns
why another ?
Hard to find Spurs player that hard carries.
 They are so great as a team.
Alone?
 Why would he be alone?
 He's Danish, not Korean so there is a very insignificant difference when it comes to cultural aspects.
Thanks man :)
just wondering what rank you are
you put XDG and Lemondogs in the same little group, which makes me want to ask if you meant Vulcun from S3 or XDG in S4?
 Just curious
Of the 8 teams that made it into playoffs, 2 teams had a SSO that sucked for no apparent reason and no other competition in their group.
Finales Funkeln
Nice unibrow
Then make chromas for skins cost IP and chromas for base skins cost RP.
you wont.
* Gilius
* Gilius
* Gilius
* Gilius
* Gilius
Exactly, also a lot of those chromas look really bad, and not as good as the Riot made ones (Lee Sin's chromas look awesome).
This is actually really serious for Ducky.
If in the summer Origen will do poorly and Roccat on the other hand will be much better, it will seem like it was Ducky's fault all along.
Interesting levels of pathetic.
Chroma packs?
 no thanks ive got photoshop.
morgana, probs just op.
[](/rammus) ok
Clearly you don't have self-control either.
 You seem to want to piss on my idea without any reason for it.
 It's a good idea.
 You just don't understand it or can't see it's purpose (for some strange reason you think this can harm things?
?
?
).
 You are basically saying: "ah lets not have extra options guys, because I don't like this idea.
" Flaming is as uncontrollable as drug addiction because it's an urge (drugs have extra chemical addictive properties, but it is still a matter of self-control in the end; if you have the self-control you can overcome addiction), just as drugs, just as video games, etc.
 The people who lack self-control are the same people who get addicted to things and obsess over things and the same people getting suspended/chat-restricted etc.
**If there is a problem: people continue to be toxic.
 Then there must be a solution: make a way for them not to be toxic (allow them to opt out of chat).
**
If people had total self-control, we wouldn't need tribunal, bans, rehabs, AA, or prisons.
Why do you fail to understand this concept?
 It's a good idea.
 It could solve toxicity.
 Toxicity hasn't been solved with what riot has done at all.
Tristana was pretty bad during the BT rush meta.
 She had no optimal build paths.
 IE was bad as a first item, and BT wasted a lot of early game power, because she didn't have any AD ratios.
 The only decent starter items were Bork and Statikk, both still bad, but less bad than the alternatives.
Only good ADC in NA is Sneaky, rest are non relevant 
Doublelift?
 Never won anything after being one of the oldest players
WildTurtle?
 Everyone says Lustboy wins bot 1 v 2
Altec?
 Just got fucking relegated
Apollo?
 Please.
Cop?
 lol.
Maplestreet?
 Would be better off playing tetris
I do not think it is needed which is why I posted.
Not gonna argue with someone who thinks that flaming is as uncontrollable as people who get addicted to drugs.
Gl with getting your good idea to the front page.
I'm pretty sure people just like the way "get rekkles" sounds more.
Really hope someone makes a reddit thread showing instructions on how to do this, or make a simple tool to do it easily or something that reaches front page.
.
So why is Alex Ich not an option for TDK?
 I thought he performed very well that series.
 Why the fuck would you pick up the mid laner of the team your sub just dumpstered on.
You're that guy.
Pretty much super easy.
I agree, for the FIRST time in my 3 years of playing league.
 I don't need to be scared to use a meele tank vs an akali or riven.
 I just carefully farm and get my Challenging smite.
 Because when they JUMP on ME, I finally have an answer to say "Sorry, I'm a tank" and not "Uh, oh, I'm dead in 2 spells and the ult".
I no longer feel like I lost lane since the loading screen.
 I really love it.
Ye but YoungBuck plays like a plat in the LCS as well.
Why did Riot tell them they had to tone it down though?
 Sneaky consistently gets 20k viewers, and they are hilarious together.
 But he explicitly said Riot said he had to stop saying 'welcome to my butthole' when people subbed.
 I get the are technically a Riot employee, because they are playing in their league, but shouldn't this be outside of their control?
was there anything about it in the patch notes ?
I have a picture of me playing Katarina, and I did true damage to myself.
.
i don't care how it comes out just don't give him dreads they are a huge mistake 
i'd imagine you have nearly 300 cs by the 30 minute mark.
 which you'll probably your core crits item already.
 while it's the best idea to stack that passive with avarice blade.
 you'll probably be ahead by i don't know the exact mathematical number but it'll be a pretty big amount of gold.
pick order>call order.
The reason why her mobility is a problem is because of her ult costing no mana lol.
 If it costed mana it'll make her more decisive in her trades, how she roams, when she uses her R Distortion.
Giving her a no mana cost ult is just as toxic as giving kayle a 0 mana cost ult that gives you invulnerability on a VERY low cd but thats another story for later.

It's funny that most people from EU are rooting for Yusui and people from NA rooting from Incarnation.
Holy shit this is annoying.
 I've taken up the habit of clicking lane then buying times so by the time the lag ends I'm halfway to lane
No offense to Jacob because he's a good journalist but his understanding of the professional scene and rating players can be quite off.
Downvote.
Noc is pretty strong in soloq right now

"I guess you're out of the LCS bitch, he just pretended like he was Shiptur and you're Nintendude"
so i guess quality shitpost
In that case, yeah I agree, but if they have a traditional ADC than I'd go FH
well he doesnt play that much of ranked
i played vs him in a normal some days ago
No he just seems like a dick in general.
 I don't think his father approves of his behavior very much.
As a yasuo main, I just wish annie doesn't ever find tibbers
EU seems to have a lot more better players partially because they have a larger playerbase.
 EU's biggest issue is lack of organization.
You literally pulled a random number out of your ass to use as an argument.
 Try again with a stronger argument.
Holy moly that Annie attack range has gone form short to "dont even bother trying to aa" range
platyTrees
"our average player base in this region is too poor to pay for these recolours, so instead of having all of them raging at us, we just won't sell these shit here at the moment"
I don't my post was clear.
 People were complaining that it was *unfair* and should never happen.
 There **were** some sentiments along the lines of 'these replacements are worse anyway* but people were really complaining about how *unfair* it was that coast was screwing over rhux and goldenglue.
No one was angry because of how bad the decision was.
 They complained the players didn't deserve to be treated that way.
It's that is unfair then this is also unfair.
 Do you think its unfair only when the player is being replaced by someone who isn't better than him?
In my opinion if your management decides to replace for whatever reason you sucks for you.
 Too bad.
 Players can't take it as a slap to the face if the replacements aren't as skilled as them.
 They get to choose who is on their team.
 These situations are both the same to me.
Yeah, and BP knew what it was doing with the pipeline in the Gulf coast?
 Just because a company is massive and successful doesn't mean they don't fuck up and can't make mistakes.
 It's such a fallacious argument to continually go back to "I think they know what they're doing.
" Sometimes, they miss the mark.
 This is called feedback.
faker even make plays on ad.
.
What happen to champion leveling on PBE?
 At first when chroma came out i thought they were linked together so you had to play a champion well enough to unlock the skin.
I like how you claim that another market crash is coming yet can't name a reason why it will happen other than bullshit blanket statements.

I'm a huge C9 fan and none of them are top 10 players.
if I would be in steelback place now i would feed MSI as hell.
.
I don't think you are following the conversation.
 Dunkey took 5 tries to get to gold.
 The poster said that having to go through it 5 times makes you feel like you belong in silver.
 The reply was that it does mean the person belongs in silver.
 Ergo by that logic Dunkey would belong in silver.
Furthermore.
 Mathematics BWAHAHAHAHA.
.
 you probably couldn't solve an ODE even if you were given a Laplace cheat sheet.
But hey, since you're so adamant about maths:

I mean.
 how much more really needs to be said before you all get it?
 What makes it even more obvious is the type of people who religiously defend it without knowing even a little bit of math.
 I mean, the shit has been mostly *proven* ineffective at this point and you people are *still* blindly defending it.
So after the maths literally show you a video outright spelling out for you that it doesn't, in fact, work fine at all.
 Do you still go with mathematics or are you suddenly going to seek out a desperate attempt at validation to spare your ego?
I bet it's the latter.
 I just fucking BET it will be the latter.
Oh and even though your poorly veiled attempt at personal attacks shouldn't even warrant response, I'm Diamond 3 right now.
 I got it pretty easy by simply buying a gold account and ranking it up to Diamond where I sit here chillin'.
See, it's fanboys like you that make this game garbage with your incessant and uneducated circlejerk all while not knowing a damn thing you're talking about.
That's what they want us to think.
The problem is that when your entire argument relies entirely on the skill level of sheep, SHEEP for gods sake.
 I mean seriously if sheep is the missing link that separates your team from victory or humiliating failure, then no you are not a good team.
But both teams are being dced, not only one.
 That's why I thought it wasnt drophack
Gas Chamber Singed
9/11 Corki
I'm of the opinion that this was a very necessary move.
 Now that being said, I'm really not a fan of that argument at all.
You're saying, "look at their credentials.
" Instead of debating the logic behind the move.
Your logic does not hold.
 SHRC and White Sword were not nearly on the level of OMG or EDG.
This is a way better idea.
 Make it a boots upgrade ffs.
As is it's unplayable.
Huni will give love to all of us
Nobody cares about the adc
Huni is love, Huni is life
Or give some to Zac, considering they say his skins are too hard to make.
Incarnati0n is accepted by most pros as the western Apdo.
 If it was only a couple fanboys it would be an empty statement.
 However, it is not.
 Incarnati0n is THAT good.
But now suddenly something that was intended to cost money doesn't.
 It sure sounds nice but then again so does having free anything.
 The game you are playing is free to play and Riot is a company so they want to make profit.
 Does it seem like robbery to you to pay for these skin?
 Maybe but it's still not 10% of the robbery companies like ubisoft are commiting so just live with it.
 Different ways for payment (like 1 at a time) are reasonable proposals but free stuff is a lot to ask for.
I'm sorry to hear you're diagnosed with down syndrome.
 My condolences.
True ^^
Super Galaxy Rumble just because his quotes are hella annoying
Bless your soul.
 I'm still going to look, but yeah I remember it as a response to a donation to which is good since I can ironically skip all the game play.
Annie for Mana dependant mage.
 Mordekaiser or Katarina for Non mana user mage.
Garen for Non mana user Tank, Darius or Malphite for mana user tank.
Ashe is the best entry level adc, and for jungle it has to be either Udyr, Volibear or Sejuani for tanks, Yi and Warwick for assasins.
Hope that helps.
You'd rather go to Giants ^.

So i provided 2 examples and you have a vague recollection of a person who doesn't play the game at a high level and admits to not focusing on itemization saying that double lifts comments were taken out of context.
 Keep in mind that Genja was probably the best performing member of Gambit in that game three where he "built wrong".
Look I don't like the idea of chromas either, and I won't be buying any myself, but people need to stop trying to "subtly" be like well its not a REAL skin so lemme have it for free.
 I'm broke as shit, I'm not a gamer really, I just love playing League with a couple buddies of mine, it's given me more sheer hours of enjoyment than any other game and they gave it to me for free.
 I bought a couple skins when I had a bit of extra money, namely Astronaut, and I wanted the skins for sure, but mostly I was glad that a broke ass motherfucker like me could afford to pay what little I could back to RIOT for the gift they gave me for free.
 Its a free game, if you like playing it then you gotta quit bitching about them trying to make money, how the fuck do you think they are capable of releasing new champions, balance shifts, and all the other fucktons of programming they have to do?
 Like fuck man, it's free to play, it's the most popular game in the world, it's helping gamers make the first strides towards being respected (outside of Korea) for their skills, and it's constantly evolving.
 That doesn't happen for free, neither do the servers, or the work RIOT is tryin to do to make competitive E-Sports a thing that people who don't game don't immediately scoff at.
I dunno man, just seems like a lot of people do a lot of bitching about the free to play game they spend endless hours on.
 So you lagged for a few games, or found a bug, people always seem to rag on RIOT's programming, but fuck man, at least they're DOING it, could you?
 Doesn't seem like it has any more problems than should be expected for such a big game, or any more than are found in any number of other games to me.
 If you're playing a game that didn't cost you a dime on a regular basis, if it's something you enjoy and was made available to you for free just fucking chill out already.
 The game was free, now you want free access to the way they can earn revenue without making anyone pay for the game as well?
 Get real man, this isn't freemium shit, it's just visual changes for people who can afford to grab a look they like more, it doesn't make the game unbalanced or unfair or take anything away from you.
 I see people complaining that they've played so much league that they have insane amounts of IP and nothing to buy with it, so let them get some chromas with it, and I'm just like, what, really?
 You spent so much time playing a game that was free that you can't buy anymore content with the free in game money they give you so that it can make money and not become a pay to win game.
 And those countless hours of playing a free video game that let you accrue more free in game cash than you need to unlock every character and all the runes available, so you're somehow entitled to free access to more shit too?
 Oh but you've been playing since SEASON ONE MAN, LEAGUE WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT YOU, right?
 Well that's weird, because it didn't get this big just cause you were one of the people who got in on the ground floor, there were a fuck of a lot of people that were right that with you, and aren't asking for more free bells and whistles because they're somehow owed it since it's not that expensive for riot to make color changes?
 You got hours of free enjoyment, you weren't OWED that, you were GIVEN that, and you sure as shit aren't entitled to more free content.
 Just because the free to play business model worked well enough for RIOT to make money off of something they aren't charging their players anything for doesn't mean that they should have to give people more free shit.
 It means they made a great thing and gave it out for free and still made money off of it.
 That's called succeeding at business, and being cool people who managed to become a successful business while still making the content that they produce 100% free to play.
 Why don't you go make a better, more popular, free game without any incentives to actually, I dunno, pay you for your work, and then you can bitch ok?
 I'm fucking 24, I didn't go to college, wasn't a good enough student to get a scholarship, wasn't able to pay for it, I'm bat shit crazy with chronic insomnia and bipolar disorder, you think I'm rolling in dough?
 In this economy?
 In our generation?
 I have friends with four year degrees glad they were able to find a job paying just about minimum wage, because they have a full time job which they spent months and months applying and working anywhere and everywhere without ever getting hired for more than part time.
 Shit's tough for our generation, we're becoming adults in a world that has less and less incentive to hire us, or treat us fairly, and lots of ordinary people just born into poverty, because they aren't smarter or better or more experienced at anything than the people who are lucky enough to have a leg up, there's a lot people in our generation who just can't find work, and it's not like welfare checks and food stamps leave you lots of cash to spend on entertainment, 15 bucks for a movie that's an hour and a half long?
 Some unbelievably expensive monthly rate for cable, another for internet, because they're the only game in town and if you want either you don't have any alternatives, I don't even own a console anymore, but games are like what, 60 bucks?
 Most with like 2 hours of campaign and limited replay value?
 We need people like RIOT and webcomic writers and everonye else who is finding ways to make money off the people who CAN pay, and still let those who just can't afford it legally access it?
 Fuck man, be thankful someones figuring out new ways to produce entertainment without charging you a dime for it, especially if you're one of those people who can't afford to buy skins and shit.
 I mean, if the price of a chroma pack is unreasonable to you, surely anything that's not free to play is out of your price range, so you must be pirating everything else, and what with the internet service providers actually trying to catch people pirating now it's become like speeding, everyone does it, but the more you do it the more likely you'll get caught, fuck up enough and they'll discontinue your service now.
 Poor older hippie friend of mine got his internet cut because he got caught downloading a couple times, which was the first time I've ever seen that happen, but it proved that it can, and now he has no internet.
 Be happy there are companies who realize that their are better solutions to piracy then punishing the poor and are doing what they can to provide free legal entertainment and just quit bitching already.
 I've been up for 3 days so I have no clue if I'm making sense, but I'm too out of it to notice I'm ranting like a crazy person til I've already done it, so fuck it, here's my 2 cents, which I will not actually be donating because I'm a crazy fucking broke as loser.

He and Cop got on really well, genja is genja, and Pinoy seems to be a bit of a hot head.
It might not be Edward's fault.
I do think he would be, but TSM usually relies on Bjerg to carry games.
 So I think they're kind of averse to putting him on a support mid laner.
was completely opposite lmao
He outlaned bjerg once, got out laned once in a bad matchup and got the famous TSM 3 man gank once.
 All in his first week of ever scrimming against the best team in the West rofl.
Really stupid idea, maybe if you're going to waste time writing out this much on an idea.
 Make sure it isn't completely idiotic first.
Not too expensive though, and if that were the case they'd need to change all skin prices.
 Or change the RP cost, but they did it in January.
Rekkles left because the old Fnatic was tired and many of them had plans outside of Fnatic.
 He wanted a motivated team and Alliance was the team "created to win worlds", whats more ambitious than that?
 He even said it in vlogs that he wanted a team with the same mentality as him.
 The mentality of practicing all day.
 That was why Tabzz left, he was burnt out and stressed from the strict practices.
 Rekkles and Alliance's attitude was a perfect fit, its just that the management sucks and their collective playstyle doesnt fit.
look at his face.
 i dont think new minion have one, they wear hoodie.
"when botlane was hard carrying" you might mean "when yellowstar was hard carrying".
 Rekkles did nothing and was way less better than he was supposed to.
Hes asking for it to be added for TP,because it has been addef for TF shen and pantheon.
 Not the other way around
Just because it stopped 5 other people doesn't mean it will stop 10 other people.
Japanese Velkoz.
 Swiggity Swooty gonna get some schoolgirl booty.
nice!
Scrims don't show up on match history, as they're often on tournament realm
You need stable internet and a computer to play league.
 You can play soccer on a deserted island with a coconut.
It amazes me how many people don't understand the difference between a good player and a good team.
>Steeelback is playing really nice
being nice how?
 letting the opponent win every lane phase?
yes i agree
This is awesome.
 Never knew about it.
 Those sneaky developers.
Nice find.
I love chromas and the idea of them.
 Time to buy all the available ones among my three accounts.
not going to buy a ward skin with rp
iirc someone played that in eu last year or something idk 
Need some reddit detectives 
AD version of AP kog with a stronger early/mid game (according to bjergsen stream) 
that's awesome dude
I have 10k RP saved up ust to buy every chroma pack that gets released on all accounts just to piss this subreddit off
People that dont own the skin have to pay 1565 to get the chroma and skin.
chroma packs suck dick
Ye but think about Incarnation?

That goes for pretty much anything in arguments regarding TSM in any way.
 Its impossible to argue against them in any way on this sub.
 If CLG was a successful team, they'd be just as bad, because their fanbase is pretty big too, the only reason you can argue against CLG is because they keep failing in the same fashion, basically making it a meme.
 And from europe it would be FNC fans.
 All these arguments about Steelback.
I just took shots on the 3 biggest fanbases in the west, bring the downvotes.
The last part seems entirely inaccurate
he has the power over the team.
Hey man!
You do a fine job and have a growing fanbase so you're doing something right.
 To be honest that opinion grew out of the Challenger Series stuff with you and Phreak where it was a little less strict/professional as LCS comes across as.
 Sometimes comedy was forced/stretched too far.
 I will say I have steadily warmed up to your casting over the Spring Split, kind of like most people describe Deficio's casting.
I hope yours is as well good sir and keep up the hard work.
Maybe I'm just salty about your dance moves being a bit better than mine :\^)
>Implying that English-speakers or natives don't troll, feed, rage and afk to the same capacity.
ayyyyy
50% chance
idgaf about mechanical skill.
 Steelback fit the team playstyle.
 C9 didnt rely on Sneaky to carry back in the day, and they still dominated NA, its all about team fit.
 Meh, I personally dont like this change, but i guess we'll see
I used to main lux, but now when I do play her, I play her with ms quints because basically any jungler can gank you easily especially with the meta mid laners.
 But yes, it's very difficult to farm with her now while trading + mama costs 
7%
damn that was brutal.
 1 million pot?
 shiiiiit
I have yet to see a good argument for this.
that it's only been "I want the chance to try Champs I don't own".
Genja IS future
that's actually hilarious.
Welcome to league of legends, have you been helped?
And your point is one-sided.
 You ignore just how similarly terrible it is for the player being replaced just because a well-liked player is the one doing the replacing.
When I'm playing tanky champions or assassins I'll teleport in as long as I can initiate a team fight or get out.
 I'm going in with it on the regular.
I would make a case for a 60-90 second cooldown.

He didn't come all the way across the atlantic to be outshined by David Bloomquist.
 It's already a wrap.
 KORE WA MOU OWATTA.
Faker had to fly through Copenhagen so he could beat up the EUW ranked solo queue before a layover in NA where he'll try out for C9.
 After 2 games that end in 20 minute ff's, C9 gives him the job.
 Faker gets on his plane that evening and flies back to Korea to beat the GE Tigers this weekend.
if you have 4 + gb of ram you should be fine, i'm not an expert or anything just someone who knows random things about computers!
.
if i think back at my decisions when i was 17/18 i cant be even mad at rekkles without being a hypocrite
I just hope the whole Alliance debacle incduced some humility into him.
 He is just such a great player and I'd be really happy if he'd be be back on the team.
 Steelback is fine, but arguably he is just not as good of a player.
In all honesty, just one little buff to the E damage, and i would already die happy, i dont want to auto every minion after throwing an E if im in a hurry to go bot or something

Reading your edit, there lies the dilemma of e-sports.
 Nobody takes it seriously.
Better yet, Jesiz becomes SK's new ADC after training with Shaolin monks for a few months.
do you have video of it?
It would be VERY surprising if it turns out this way, and not Pinoy getting the boot.
Dick move, bro.
Pretty much 100% that Incarnation is replacing Hai.
 All the proof is there.
 Jack Entienne just picked him up from the airport.
So?
 Didn't matter to other regions, why would it matter to us in special?
 There are contries where RP is more expensive and they still didn't change it.
Pick order>Call order.
 But If im high pick order I sometime ask everyone for prefs so I can try and get everyone in a comfortable role
it stops on first target hit bro
Fiora, Wukong is bursty, Riven, Talon
It sounds like they are trying to steal as much money from people who really want the chromas before opening them up as a mastery bonus and refunding the RP people already spent as credit.
 It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that they would test something that Heroes of the Storm offers for free, just to see how much they can steal from their fan base.
Why do you think thooorin does it?
This is actually a ludicrous amount of power.
I don't think you have near enough understanding of the power of pull abilities.
 Take Orianna ult, for example.
 What you are doing is giving Aatrox a larger range, lower damage, more reliable orianna ult.
 That's INSANELY overpowered.
i like the idea a lot, but they would have to nerf the shit out of his other abilities to make it a reality.
200 RP is actually insane if you consider that creating a chroma is done in under 2 Minutes.
But he arguably did perform worse than Rekkles.
 Not that it was not expected, but he still did not as good as Rekkles.
> Make the Chromas for ANY RP PURCHASED SKINS cost IP and/or earned through champion mastery.
The thing i don't like about that, is you are then forcing someone to spend Real money to receive a reward for doing something in game.
 A better solution would be making 1-2 recolors for each base champ and having those be unlocked with the mastery system.
Champion, *would you kindly* stand still?
I used a word proportional to the statement I was talking about.
I think that stating that the pricing currently held is **ridiculous** is **obscene.

If you want to discuss why you think it's an overstatement, feel free.

A reasonable voice?
 If only stuff like this wasn't downvoted into oblivion regularly.
I personally saw the Incarnati0n hype as silly for the reason you stated: ultimately no one knows who will fit C9 the best.
 I would think top teams are more cautious these days given terrible failures like Coast.
 People automatically assume Incarnati0n is miles better when there are many reasons why he (or Yusui for that matter) might not work out; maybe he doesn't deliver as hard in lane as he does in solo queue, maybe his shot calling is terrible.
 Furthermore, maybe C9's style just isn't for him.
Would be funny if the person they choose is neither Yusui or Incarnati0n though.
 I imagine there would be a quite an uproar.
WizardCrab, I like you.
 Please don't give in to these idiots who want skins for free.
Chromas are skins.
 Skins cost RP.
 End of story.
I may represent a small percentage of the LoL community, but I can say firmly I am done with playing this game due to this change.
I have played since season 1.
 Various accounts, all on free time and I never really cared about ranked.
 Just wanted to play with friends.
In the limited amount of free time I have, mostly no more than an hour which forced me to quit other games in favor of this one, I am now reduced to playing ARAMs almost exclusively if i want to play more than 1 match.
Giving everyone a true dmg poke combined with a follow up at lvl 1?
 That is just unbalancing.
 Some champions are nothing without their ability to poke and kite.
He didn't reject a spot on Elements starting roster.
 No were does he say he rejected all offers from Elements, nor does he say he rejected a spot as a sub.
 Dailydot never said he declined a spot on the starting roster.
It isn't hypocrisy for the exact reason you stated.
 Getting Altec, an ADC who is indisputably a top 5 ADC in NA and undeniably better than Louis the weakest ADC through the challenger series is a good sound decision.
Compared to Coast which got two mid Diamond (NOT EVEN DIAMOND 1) Koreans in place of your two best performing players is a fucking slap in the face to those players, and NA as a region.
Yes it sucks for Louis, but even he has to be able to admit that Altec is a better ADC than him.
 The same cannot be said for Coast's decision.
 That is the difference and it is a big one.
this is pretty cool, not much down here in sc though.
Froggen?
 :D jk its actually P1NOY!

Well.
.
If we are on the subject of skins, why isn't a Goku Ripoff skin for Wukong not a thing yet?
 I understand that there are copyrights but can we just get an orange or blue chroma to be young Goku?
Actually, as someone who shreds tanks, in this meta she is alright.
pls no stupidity 
How do people know these scrim results?
 xD
Nah it's not you, I mean I am used to but I understand, if the ball was red, I would certainly dodge it better, same goes for some TF or Varus skins with light-blue cards/arrows on a light-blue floor.
it's just that i'm having low hopes for this community, i've run into foul people and i dont feel motivated to be a generous guy when theres none in return
Inb4 literally every targetted Q spell in the game is changed to a skillshot.
I remember if you shot anivia Q out of bounds it would crash the game as well
In relevance to NA maybe in relevance to all-time all regions no

He said that if the rumours are true then SK isn't even getting Rekkles then why would Incarn even ponder going to SK.
He probably makes a decent-6 figure, though granted, he's got a lot more time to work on it now that he's not playing anymore.

It wouldn't change her too much.
 The real issue with Annie in bot lane is her E.
 It's almost a Leona W in lane.
 You can't trade against that.
If you don't build dcap, you're going a build that doesn't have a lot of AP.
 Mpen "increases" your base damage (by just letting you ignore the defensive stats they built).
 Some kennens don't go dcap for a few items (something like zhonyas -> guise -> abyssal -> rylais).
 depends.
I don't think you really focus on mpen on kennen anymore than other mages though.
 If there were any champ that I would say you really focus on mpen for it would be rumble, not kennen.

Im pretty sure thats to do with one of your defensive masteries.
You're just trying to play with words, rekkles is a good match with fnatic.
 I'm not a fan of putting steeelback aside, but if they want to improve that may be how they can do it.
That's actually untrue and so is that riot is doing 'something for us'.
 It's a free to play game, the business model relies on the customer loving the product, they aren't just doing everything as a cash grab but they also aren't doing us any favors.
 If you want chromas, you will buy them.
 It's not a ploy for cheap money, the cost of developing the skin has nothing to do with its final price, the price is set at a level where it matches the value it has to the player, because their business model has buying as a choice (and they want it to be a choice that feels appropriate to the content's perceived value).
basically it's just as wrong to say chromas are a cash grab as it is to say chromas are a favor from riot.
A pile of 1 billion dollar bills weighs 2,204,620 pounds!

Faker, cool, PawN, Dade, rookie, CoCo, W1less, and zzitai and maybe GBM are all probably ahead of him.
Naut maaaybe, but Kennen definitely not.
 He needs a way to keep people in the slicing maelstrom which means he's better at secondary engage following up on something than being the first one to go in himself 
as my favourite champion i honestly always wanted a rework for her, part of it is that she's only relevant right now because of the TP/Smite which is going away soon, and the other part is that i think she's also the only champion that transform but her moveset doesn't really change so to speak, her abilities just become more AOE but i would like a different moveset altogether.
 Other then that, once this TP Smite meta passes, theres no reason to pick her over someone just as tanky with more reliable CC like Maokai.
Need to change damage and CD.
 Still feels like wait till 6 for some tanks though so feels the same.
Some kind of protection should be added instead since most poke comps win if you can get 8+ kills for free.
 Otherwise you can usually come back depending on your team and morale.
He has gotten much better at conveying his thoughts without rambling.
the only one who would be top3 in their role would be tabzz.
 i see them getting top5 at best.
Shadowplay
They most definitely will.
not even in EUW LCS?
 do you understand that being top team in euw is way harder than in NA?
 the 2nd place in NA was a crappy team that was on a slump the entire split, if euw and na played all together places between 2nd to 6th would probably be all european (and even TSM.
 i wanna see MSI =o)
I think if Yusui looks decent in his tryouts he will be picked up by C9.
 Especially since he is familiar with the C9 organization.
Don't eat Gordo's.

>He was a carry threat from what I'm told.
 He's done well in mid and outclassed Shiphtur & Huhi.
 He's also given Bjergsen a good run for his money in 4 out of 6 scrims, even outfarming him to snowball in one game
No?
 It definitely won't overheat.
 It's a pretty new laptop, and Leagues is hardly the most RAM-intensive game out there.
 You should be good to play it on the lowest settings.
He did say that, I was watching his stream than too.
 It was in response to a donation question.
I guess he started before?
 But sure he has a long way to go before he gets LCS top 2 Midlaner like Incarnati0n is 
Rekkles could of gone to NA and join CLG, hope he is just a sub for Fnatic

> a standard recolor (Older skins mainly) were all 520 rp and now you can get 3 recolors for 590 rp which is honestly a pretty good deal for people who don't want to pay for or can't afford some of the more pricey skins.
You half-answered your own wonder; quality has been increasing.
 So have expectations.
> Hell, some of them even look pretty nice like the Blitz Chroma and Blue Lucian.
Absolutely.
 I really like the Lee Sin ones, if I'm honest.
 That said, I'm a bit of a suck-up for Bruce Lee.
> Personally I doubt I will buy many of the Chroma Packs but I think its a great idea and would love for Riot to continue making them for the people that do want them.
It's my stance; whoever feels that they will get value out of their purchase (and why not?
 It's inexpensive) absolutely should go for it.
 I'm not going to; I'm not playing LoL much currently and I don't have a solid income.
 Maybe if I feel like it randomly as a 'little treat' for whatever which reason, I'll do it.
 Chromas in the end are a nice extension that allows people to get slightly more out of their skins; the likelihood now of someone thinking "I kind of wish that X skin was tinted X way.
" has now decreased quite a bit with Chromas.
But of course, the complaining that people will do has increased, because it's believed they should receive them for free.
Which doesn't make sense from a business standpoint, if you ask me.
Does nobody on this subreddit watch any other competitive sports.
 Its standard for a team to replace its weak links with stronger players when promoted to a higher division.
 Saying louis shouldn't be replaced because he "helped them get promoted" is so far from a winning mentality its not even funny.
 Esports just like regular sports is competitive and you will fall behind and become irrelevant if you don't understand this.
This needs to be higher.
>Ru, for his part, is widely considered one of the top marksmen in North America.
Excuse me?
 By whom?
 Ome thing is saying that he is a really good young talent that could be nurtured to become a top ad carry.
 But by no means whatsoever he is widely considered as a current top ad carry.
 You cannot simply hold that title when the team you're par of just got relegated.
okay you and I just disagree on what we saw.
 That's all there is to it.
Oh, I was looking at the icons like the guy said.
 Also, I thought Sivir was Diana, haha.
It's not that you focus on magic pen, but Kennen's kit often requires him to be more in the middle of the fight.
 Using auto-attacks for w passive, using e, and especially ult, Kennen is often closer than most mages and less safe.
 Hence why defensive items are generally more rushed.
Zhonya's Hourglass is a must-have, and gives him more armor, and gives him more effective HP with health.
 Rylai's is also good on him to get many procs, and gives him higher effective HP coupled with Zhonya's.
 Haunting Guise is strong because it gives him more health (not just magic pen) and if coupled with Rylai's can be strong for kiting and damaging both the backline and the frontline.
 Abyssal gives more 'magic pen' (technically magic resistance reduction), but also makes it easier for him to survive.
It's not that magic pen is so important to Kennen, it's that Kennen can play more like a frontline than most mages and typically builds more health and resistances, rather than large AP items.
I don't remember now but the meta was enormously different when triforce was bad, as well as some patch changes believe.
 I don't know where the video is now but Monte talked about how everyone took double's words out of context and was actually correct at the time.
You really seem to not know anything about America.

Mark doesn't need to do 200 true damage.
The gap closer is good enough that the champions intended to use it, tanks, would still get it.
 As is, everybody is getting it because it is half an ignite every 20 seconds.
 You've got Ziggs and Xeraths running it, when 8 times out of 10 they want to be as far away as possible from their targets.
 People are taking it strictly for damage.
Poro Toss as a summoner spell had the same scaling and for that gamemode, it was balanced.
 When compared to the other summoner spells, it is not.
Seems like they took the Poro Toss and plopped it in ARAM with little thought on what would happen.
in terms of League of Legends: The best perceived way to win.
 Including runes, masteries, builds, champions, lane setups, rotations etc.
 everything affects and determines what the meta.
The 1 term people confuse with Meta all the time is "Viability" which is just the ability to succeed.
And can actually win lane
Send all your europeans to the new world and they rebel against you.
 Bjergsen seems to be enjoying life in NA.
 Hehe history always repeats itself ye?
Korea is very far ahead player wise.
 The best Western players can compete, yes, but the sheer number of quality Korean players dwarfs the West.
 They've lost like 40 players to other regions and they're still arguably the strongest region.
 NA or EU would be absolutely crippled if that happened to them.
Decent dammage scaling ultimate that scales with her primary stat and ori has a lot of follow up and different ways to position her ult.
Definitely the same thing.

Okay I wasn't aware.
 Like I said, I wasn't 100% if it was true or not.
Player ability does not equal team ability.
 Management alone can have a huge factor on a teams performance
> benefit of being a really overhyped soloq player.
FTFY
Disregarding the reason behind him no longer being on the Elements roster, it'd be natural for him to want to join the strongest possible team.
Fnatic are coming off of an amazing split, Steelback was widely regarded as the weakest link in the team (that is not to say he didn't play a great split, but he could have contributed more) and he also has years of experience playing with Yellowstar.
He's a free agent making a sound decision to play for a strong team, it just so happens he's been there before.
And this is just a bit of speculation, I obviously don't know the guy so this should be taken with more than a grain of salt, but I highly doubt he bases what team he wants to play for by looking at who won the previous split.
 I'm fairly certain he'd return to Fnatic even if they'd gotten 4th/5th, and after Elements awful performance this split I can't blame him.
Sorry there's no tone online so I may have taken it the wrong way.
That sounds perfect wouldn't want to go overboard.
Since when was he intended to be a split pusher and duelist?
 If he was then why are 3 out of 4 of his abilities AoE?
 No other real duelist has that many AoE abilitues.
 Look at trundle,olaf,darius,garen,fiora, rengar, etc.
Ah I see, so opinions are ok.
 Unless they offend your sensibilities.
 Cool to know.
 Guess I should have seen that coming when you've written a book right here on how to best suck Riot's dick.
Still feel like 0.
25 sec cast time on Tibbers would be the best way to fix her.

yeah, even when Crumbzz was streaming and he didn't have more than 300 people watching (which is kinda sad, you'd think he would be more popular), it still felt special when he read something out loud that I wrote.
Sarcasm aside I do agree that Riot's model isn't the best.
 I was spoiled by SMITE being able to just straight up buy all the current and future Gods, as well as there being recolors you could either just unlock from playing or buy with the in-game currency.
It's definitely frustrating, but clearly Riot's business model is working for them so I don't see a reason as to why they would change it.
I never understood the Dexter hype.
The guy was at best 3rd best jungler after Meteos and Amazing.
I want pizza
i guess so lmao
Freeze might actually fit quite well, didn't think of him when i wrote that post, but with Candypanda rejoining they would rely on fredy and fox too much I think.
 While fredy is definitely one of the best western tops I think Fox can not stand toe to toe with many other midlaners (yet).

God bless him but geez.
I'm kind of surprised that 155 people give a shit about this.
 What is exciting about this announcement?
Nice music
I don't think you understand how much better SSW was that anybody in that tournament.
But hers has the slow, I never suggested a slow :v

Yea, I also thought it was going to be like "wow so cool leveling up my champions!
" but it's not like that, it's meh.
 You play games, gain points and yay.
 That's all
They are also representative of western fans who think the west are the best/close to the best.
 It's not a strawman if he's arguing against those people, and those people actually exist.
Admins can't shadowban for text posts.

Link has always been the subject of Reddit hate, Aphro hasn't from what I've seen.
 I don't know why he and DL are so indispensable to CLG.
 Maybe they're the problem.

^ok^that^sucked^I'll^leave
Well its something people can blink off from, its not like whither or anything so its not that broken.
Great post sir have a up boat.
nice job, I want to say the similar thing
Really?
 Dyrus has really been putting on alot of weight man that guy is getting fat
.
.
My guess is that Annie's weakness is supposed to be short range compared to other champions.
 But then they give her longer autoattack range than most ad carries, so they are just highlighting Annie's low range nature, without taking away from her damage or cc.
Slave owner Yorick.
 I'm so so sorry.
No, it is not.
 Is the ability for reddit to circle jerk over any change in the game because they dislike it less than 2 days from its release destroying LoL?
You can build a sunfire if you want the passive from it, but overall it's better you not take smite.
I really wouldn't want that many people from a team that just got relegated.
I have heard people said that tons 
Hm, there was another post [yesterday](http://www.
reddit.
com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/34c0et/whos_that_little_guy_3_sr_terrain/) about some previously unmentioned additions to Summoner's Rift, and I've heard somebody tell me that they've been hearing strange noises in one of their games while wandering around near Baron.
 Ultimately, who the hell knows.
 There will probably be a new champion within the next two cycles either way.
WE is definately not second best in China, and I don't think I've ever heard Monte say TSM is near the level of top Korean and Chinese teams.
Hai retired, they didn't kick him off the team
Did you read the poll?
 I didn't.
 No one did except for Riot.
 You know, the guys who said this is is what we want and then ignored all criticism saying this isn't what we want, releasing it without changes and saying the only way they'll change it if they don't make enough money.
Man, thank goodness those skins look cool, otherwise we might have some basic ethical expectations from Riot.
How are altec and pob proven players?
 Because they both proved they can't carry a team?
People LOVE pob and altec and say they are so good, but when will they show it?
 I haven't seen it.
 Why is it acceptable for Alex to come in and carry but pob and altec can't carry the team they've played with all year.
 They are mediocre at best and I'm guessing people will finally learn when they go through another round of relegations.
It's a trap.
 Some giant rat with wings tried to attack me.
What a shock, Phreak with a pun.
Really hope this isn't true.
Did this really have to leak before MSI?
 More excuses if FNC loses.

You make fun, but Heroes of the Storm does something like this (well, one skin, one time).
 You also get the chroma packs by grinding games on that toon.
.
and they apply to all skins.
Which is why I'm completely confused by Riot's decision to offer them piecemeal, for cash.
You never had me
She will get a leave, yellow letters in post screen not sure if it counts as a win or loss but it is recorded.
No, but he is the captain and the org builds around him and he is pretty much allowed to handpick the roster
Anyone who believes Steelback is better than Rekkles is delusional.
No, debonair Taric.
^our^bodies^are^ready
>10% from your support item
The gold items are garbage, Talisman is good if you need disengage, if you need a speed boost engage get RG which has no CDR.
If you're playing a support that builds Mikaels and you want to get Zekes then just ask your jungler to get locket.
 If not then you can get it as well and have 35% CDR.
Don't build Morello's or Rylai's on any of those champions.
 Don't build any AP on Nami beyond the 5 you get from spellthiefs.
He already has a chroma, its purple and called special weapons zac.
So, i'm buying them all.
Yea, look what happened to Alliance
Correct.
It has a higher range, deals true damage on impact, and has a 20s cooldown.
 Not to mention no tether range like Lee's second Q.
Dyrus
Santorin
Bjergsen
Wildturtle
Lustboy
Do you think any of the Red posters have any power over this?
 Let's be real for a second.
 Let's follow the line up to who controls Riot: Tencent, a huge Chinese corporation.
For Tencent, Riot is just a piece of the business it does.
 A meaningful and growing piece, surely, but do you know how huuuge Tencent is?
So you guys can bitch at the Riot employees on here as much as you want, maybe they'll float the idea up until it hits the CFO, but when whatever Controller at Tencent hears the idea, especially after the money starts rolling in, they'll have a good laugh.
People are going to buy these.
absolutely ridiculous i have paid for a skin and apparently only paid for 1/4th of it
People still think he's in BR?
I think they're pretty much evenly matched as seen in the 3rd place games but other toplaners such as Quas himself have gone on record saying that impact gives him/them the most trouble out of any toplaner.
I am, alright fair enough MSI will explain it easily
yup, pretty sure there were atleast 1 season 2 champ release with 3150
can't say for sure tho, since my memory sucks.
RIP tank meta.
we're going back to the Lee Sin meta boyz.
I knew it was only so long before Riot diverted from its "We want more stuff to be viable in the jungle, we're sorry for making things so hard on you!
" mantra
I've heard "even a stopped clock is right twice a day" but what's the squirrel version?
 Something like "Even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes?
" I imagine the wording is better though.
Am on mobile, mirror?
Bad comparison.
Flash is on a 300 second cooldown.
 Mark/Dash is on a 20 second cooldown.
this will never happen
zac will never get a new skin
Yeah!
 No one has ***ever*** said that in the history of League of Legends!
We have an amazing Carmike Theatre in Indianapolis and I know for a fact it would sell out.
You're welcome!
Bought the Garen chroma right away.
 I love them.
Agreed.
 These pigs dont deserve to live.
psh, the 80's called.
They say "hey, what's the future like?
"
Yeah I got nothing.
They lowered her base damage across the board and raised her ratios in the last set of annie changes, it was to push her out of a support role and into a more mage role.
 We all know how that turned out.
 Her stun is just too good (and her auto harass)
Because it can be cancelled by the user, at any moment.
Afaik the pings only proc when the user can no longer stop the port.
Tf isn't an engage champ?
 The fuck are you talking about?
 Also all he has to do is w again to get his stun up while Annie has to use 4 spells to get it up.
 If 4 people burn flashes because they see an annie run up to them then it is their fault for standing together, not running away sooner, and not ccing her.
 I'm dropping salt all over this thread?
 I've commented 3 times because people are posting false information.
Bruh they've been turning to edited shows since at least last Summer.
Varus is powerful.
What about ad caster varus
there is a new team called Schröt Kommando.
 i think they will be great one day !
A lot of people, myself included, are annoyed that there are no in-game rewards for time played or achievements.
 One skin once a year, for a champion that has generally been nerfed soon after?
 A ward skin if you spam games with a team?
 Oh boy.
It's highly underwhelming.
 This seemed like a good way to introduce a reward system with in-game content for people who do well, and instead it was turned towards profit.
 I used to buy a ton of skins, I won't be buying anymore unless there's some form of actual in-game reward anymore.
 More and more of Riot's model is to move things away from IP and into RP, doing so can alienate people who previously spent RP.
Simply increasing the ways in which people can pay you does not actively increase the profit.
I have no clue why people would think the pricing is too much though, a standard recolor (Older skins mainly) were all 520 rp and now you can get 3 recolors for 590 rp which is honestly a pretty good deal for people who don't want to pay for or can't afford some of the more pricey skins.
 Hell, some of them even look pretty nice like the Blitz Chroma and Blue Lucian.
Personally I doubt I will buy many of the Chroma Packs but I think its a great idea and would love for Riot to continue making them for the people that do want them.
Genja is like House Tyrell; he is playing three dimensional chess while everyone else plays tic tac toe.
They already said it wouldn't happen lol
Thank you.
 I don't live in TN, but I still hate it when guys stare at me as if I am some sort of treasure.
Can you go into any detail on the pros and cons of this new Ryze.
 Also have you as a Ryze player experienced any of the issued I talked about?
Would have sucked without mark too.
Um Meteos was easily the best jungler in NA last year.
Sorry for the bad vertical video, I didn't have any recording software up so I just grabbed my phone.
We joined the game and had no champion, no gold and couldn't move.
 Everyone on my team had the same problem but some of the other team were playing fine.
So I had to sit and watch the enemies freely take down the towers.
 After about 10 minutes of watching the game crashed and could not reconnect.
 It counted as a leave, I lost LP and got leaver buster.
Yeah but he's trying to indirectly say "bad team no chalenjour gg.
God I hope C9 gets him, I wanna see the clash of the euro god midlaners bjerg vs incarnati0n.

Oh lord, the Kalista and ~~Pikachu~~ yellow Kennen plays
Server: NA
Type of Bug: In-Game Bug
Description: Elise can no longer self-cast rappel 
Steps to reproduce: Go into any game mode.
 Try to cast rappel (not onto a target) via self-cast.
Expected result: Elise rappels
Observed result: Elise does nothing
Reproduction rate: 100%
System specs: HP laptop.
Elise can still do a target-less rappel if she clicks E with your mouse cursor within the range indicator.
 If she clicks outside of that circle, she will walk to the edge of the range and then cast it.
 It is extremely clunky to use this way and also GREATLY increases the chance of accidentally rappeling onto a minion or enemy when using the ability during cluttered teamfight situations.
 To avoid this I've always self-casted my rappel if I didn't want to immediately drop on a target.
 Now the self-cast does nothing.
 IMO this is a pretty big bug that makes playing her extremely clunky.
I am still getting downvoted on this.
 Am I wrong?
!
They played TSM, Fusion and Dignitas.
 They stomped Dig and Fusion and did quite well against TSM.
WE's form now sure.
 But please remember WE at IEM was literally formed 2 days before the days began.
Also CJ also shit the bed at the tournament.
 So having both Korean teams being horrible, it is more likely that this was not preparation/jet lag but an indication of league weakness.
Your post was removed because this issue is archived in the Riot Pls wiki thread
Bard.
66/61 W/L
well their main player is Faker.
 Easyhoon is just a sub so it only makes sense that the starting mid laner would get to choose.
And to add, maybe when you buy a skin that has chromas you could add them for a tiny amount of RP.
This is a great point on KDA and made me think of a game I had today.
 I was playing lee sin, made some early ganks blew a few flashes but nothing spectacular.
 Then I got a double kill off of a counter gank in mid.
 So now what would you do in this situation?
 You can either 
A.
 See how healthy your bot lane is and possibly go for dragon.
B.
 Push out mid and return to your jungle.
C.
 Push out mid and place deep wards to track other junglers movements.
D.
 Take buffs or camps
E.
 Just back (the worst choice)
After every "play" there needs to be something gained besides just the kills.
 Push objectives or gain vision off of these plays but don't go back to doing something you would normally do if the other team was alive.
 Also don't worry about KDA, on the lee sin game I ended like 5/7/8 or something like that but I had 2 dragon steals and the other team only got one dragon the entire game.
 It's things like that, that make a difference.
Also if you are maiming ADC in theory you should have the best KDA but look at your post game damage out put as well.
 You should also have the highest if not second highest damage output to the mid player.
These are all the things you can look at by yourself to improve.
Thanks!
 I've seen my friends (mostly Silver and above) play Riven alot, but I haven't really tried him.
 I'll save up and try him out!
The Rekkles to Fnatic still is speculation to, it's just the latest rumor in the mill.
 I get the feeling Incarnati0n himself is still very unsure on what he wants.
The best jungler not named Meteos or Amazing, lol.
That would be true if SSB was better than SSW at worlds

edit: ?( ?° ???°)?
So i bought all of them cause i really dont care about the money i just thought theyd be cool to have but they dont actually work in the client yet soooooo
[](/darius): And my axe!
Good team?
I'm sure when Incarnati0n shown up he was instantly given the spot; I don't really know of any other good talent in the mid lane.
He means people would pick the support role so the system gives them double IP, but they'd go mid or top or do whatever.
 Not actually support.
I think he wanted to get information from /r/leagueoflegends on why Fnatic was popular.
 Could have googled Fnatic but he was asking for the general populace opinion on why some players generate large threads.
So having to mesh with basically a new mid top and jungle seems good compared to the seemingly best team of the region picking you up?
I think that skins should always be a source of revenue for the company.
 Riot stated that "90% of the employees work on free elements of the game.
" I think that they should draw the line for making money somewhere.
 They have 1400 employees that are all paid well above their competitors for the same jobs, run the largest company funded e-sports campaign, run more servers then any other game company.
 They have crazy experiences.
 Riot isn't swimming in money, they are spending their money.
 I have no problem spending money on them as long as they keep me happy with amazing content that keeps me entertained.
TLDR - Keep skins as micro-transactions.
I'd lose all respect for cloud9 if they employed somebody like incarnati0n.
 It wasn't like he was just a general rager: He ddos'd and verbally abused people just because.
 I dont understand why you'd employ somebody like that or why sponsors would sponsor something like that.

 I wonder what it tastes like.
I go down the shop for my brother from time to time to get food.
 It's about £4.

He offers to buy me the same meal.
 Tasty as heck, *definitely* worth it.
 Or I could just go down twice on any different days for him and get £7 for 7 Hearthstone packs.
 I could do the same with RP if I felt like it, I'd imagine.
I see 600 points as not too expensive but too cluttered.
 It would be more appreciable to me if the Chromas were sold singularly, with part of the reason being that it's potentially a 'forced purchase' for people who are seeking only one Chroma.
 With that being said, Riot could address this issue by introducing a "Random Skin"/"Random Chroma" option, so you start with one you own at random each game.
Like you'd said, though; it's an insanely low price barrier.
 The *only* way this could be a significant issue to anyone is if they have a severely limited budget and the difference between buying 1 Chroma and 3 Chromas does actually mean a great deal to them.
But as I've said before, it's not a gameplay changer.
 It's not like someone trying to extort people in need with bread.
 In that light, it's arguable that there is no 'moral compass' to follow, since this is Riot's turf entirely and the only thing that could *possibly* prevent them from selling something on League of Legends is actual legislation.
Or people's wallets, of course.

 There are specific parts of Tallahassee that you are very likely to be harassed or, hopefully not, robbed/mugged.
 If you stick to the ares OP discussed, you should be fine.
 Just don't walk around alone at night, especially in some of the worse neighborhoods.
Also on a lighter note, check out Railroad Square for some hippy/hipster fun.

First off, mark summoner spell was originally meant for tanks with no gap closers (ie:Garen) could get closer and to feel a bit more useful.
 Next, It must also be considered that it is taking up 1 out of 2 slots for a potentially more useful spell.
 Thirdly, if the enemy decides to go in on, it will most likely be because someone is out of place, or they are a fairly easy kill either way as gap closers from many other champs could do something similar.
 Lastly, the mark takes a rather slow path and if one is paying attention, may be dodged in a graceful manor.
 Although, it may be a problem for the team opposing the mark ss to have a constant worry of a random champion come flying out of nowhere.

 His Martial Cadence + Q debuff + E buff makes trades pretty beastly with your adc.

 he's even stronger.
You guys have to realize even if it hits "top-sellers" the margin between this top-selling and other skins top-selling when they get released may be drastically different.
 It's pretty easy to hit top-seller on anything new that's released if you think about its competition for best-sellers.
there was something about that in his ask.

Literally 95% Thresh, Faker had like 2 clips where it was him making a play the rest was all Thresh.

Doesn't sound broken at all.
Well if that's the case then his point when over my head D:
They didn't kick Hai so it was not a matter of what C9 wanted, it was Hai stepping down.
Remember Riot is still a company whose goal is to make money and as long as people are willing to spend money on these things they will never be free.
 It all well and good if people want them to be part of a champion mastery system of whatever but at the end of the day people will be willing to pay for chroma packs and so long as there is some profit Riot will not make them free.
 May be a bit of a harsh truth but in business money is the name of the game.
The North Remembers
Sometimes I just forget about it afterwards.
 I think about it when I'm picking a skin.
 I just thought it'd be awfully convenient to be able to do an entire transaction right there.
You're wrong, every adc needs good positioning, ashe and varus needs good positioning in lane phase when their lack of mobility can hurt them, in a teamfight though with their slows and hard CCs they are harder to get to.
Alright, since you seem to want to repost every 5 minutes, I'll repost my same response: 
"How would it be Riot's fault that EU's top team can't compete on a world-stage level?
"
Not sure what LCS you were watching but Crumbz was not "solid" and Alex was a legendary mid 2 seasons ago.
Unless your Shiptur ;P
A lot of people like the Lucian Chroma.
 This made me think about something.
 I am much more likely to purchase the base skin chroma than any of the paid skin ones.
 I feel like if I spent RP on the skin, I should be able to multicolor it with IP.
 But since I can buy the champion with IP, the base skins are worth paying RP for the chroma.
 Just my opinion
- disable cross team chat - no, i mean you already have an option to disable messages from enemies.
 it would also remove all the reactions to sick plays
- different team handles skin and champs
- limiting rank play time = angry ppl.
 they already ban some ppl and force them to play normal draft for 10 or 20 games before being unbanned
# NEXT
That makes sense.
It's a GoT reference.
I'm not actually fat :)
Chroma packs cost way to much.
no it is 3 e's you have it right in the title
does it have to be those skins or?
You gotta know your audience.
 When you're on the r/lol subreddit you need to bring it down to like a 4th grade level
I have never heard something more wrong in my life, even if you manage to snare both of them as they charge at you, you still get stunned and killed.
 Then they just kill your adc in a 2v1 after being tickled by your level 2 dmg.
 I love zyra support, but I would NEVER pick her into that lane.
they are from the same splash art.
 on the naut one you can see sivir's hand and boomerang, on sivir's you can see naut's armor.

 On the hunt for those particles!
Also, I'm quite bored and I noticed your flair.
 Want me to make a skin for anyone in a Dignitas theme?
Yes
How do you get these pictures?
Scatter the weak
do you know what mfw means
Take away all of his keys on his keyboard except for QWER and the button modifiers.
 Maybe give him the numbers too if he's a good boy.
if people would not lie.
 yes.
 this is also how circle jerking works because of that
If both your mother and I were drowning, and you could only save one, who would it be?
The GET train fell off the rails pretty dramatically after IEM.
 Everyone is on-board the SKT train now.
Copypasta of the most boring.
 I mean this is basically spam.
just because they are a rioter doesn't mean they should get 50 upboats anyway, but yeah they really salty.
 kinda wish i could see all the upvotes and downvotes
Incarnati0n himself also re tweeted it lol
Yeah because it takes a second to type my previous response and this one as well versus reading your shitty joke.
Generally, if I am high on the pick order I say something like: "I'd prefer to play anything but top and if anyone has a role they really want let me know so I don't pick it.
"
well this weekend will have some interesting picks
Well tough shit.
 That is not really an excuse for anything.
 it would be like saying get rid of skins because I don't want to buy them
Server: NA
Type of Bug: Client bug 
Description: Every time i tabb out of my game to change song ect my game black screens.
Steps to reproduce: Tabb out of dual screen set up 
Expected result: tab in and out no problems 
Observed result: Black screens but can still click on game stuff -_-
Reproduction rate: 95% 
System specs: i7, 2 sets of crossfired r290's and 2 AOC 4k gaming monitors 16GB Ram 
Even if they do it wont be exclusive lol.
people who buy rp and want it will get it, they'd be just as exclusive as normal skins lol
If they where going to do this on Florida it should had being on Miami.
This thread is gonna explode bigger than Hijacked Airplane Corki's recall 
They would just give us all wedgies no thanks 
The only point I want to argue is that Mark is incredibly oppressive because of the low cooldown.
 The damage is strong too and I'll complain about it but the low cooldown is the biggest offender.
 It has the shortest cooldown of all summoner spells.
 It closes the largest gaps of all summoner spells.
I think it's easily justifiable to want a longer cooldown on this summoner spell.
 It fits in ARAM and I think it's good that melee champions are given more power with it.
 It's incredible strong as it is though.
I got it the last time I had a Rek'Sai on my team.
 It was obnoxious.
Can this fucking circle jerk/karma bait die.
 PLEASE!
!
and op, stfu
I stopped spending money on Lol when they screwed me and my legacy skins :(
I was an addict, too.
 Every paycheck I'd make sure to put some rp on with the goal of having 1 skin per champ.
 Good skins, too.
 Never again Riot.
 Path of Exile gets most of my cosmetic money now.
I bought all of them because I think 590 RP is a great deal for 3 recolors.
 I don't know what everyone's problem is about these Chroma Packs.
 Go get a job you le fat reddit nerds.
You should have played in S1, the amount of BR ragers was insane before they had their own server.
I tried repairing my client.
 Didn't help at all.
Mediocrity is also balanced.
That's cheating!
If we didn't club them they wouldn't be getting clubbed.
Can't have that.
In the first post you said "talent" doesn't equal success I used faker to sort of say where it does.
 but you can use multiple people Bjergson for an NA less obvious example.
 When he replaced regi while they still didn't win NA they got obviously better.
I just wanted to say that talent is a factor if you look at the things you need in a player.
 And rekkles > steelback mechanically and rekkles was much better in lane.
Also there is synergy which yellow and rekkles definatly have they were a better duo than nrated and forgiven cause yellow>nrated.
i think tdk with pobelter and altec would make an amazing team.
 kez just needs more work on jungling and i think smoothie and altec can speak english fluently together which is nice for bot synergy.
 While you have 2 people to translate korean/english (pobelter+kez).
 It works well, looks good on paper.
tldr: altec+smoothie english bot duo.
 2 korean translators pob/kez and seraph does top lane stuff.
 mid top and bot can carry since they all strong in roles
or kalista with runanns or lucian with doubleshot or corki with e shred stacking bc or mf ult or new ashe q oh wait thats actually quite alot :*
You're an oxymoron.

dom, bryan's dead
It's so much better.
You could say the exact same thing about any game on steam.
am i the only one around here who doesnt wanna see incarnati0n be a part of c9?
Funny how life works, huh?
but it *is* efficient on its own.
How the fuck do people run out of mana on Braum lol, I tried to spam Q every time it's up on him and can't even get oom'd.
 His base mana is super high for a melee and Q cost is ridiculously low.
Top: I was saying calling him trash is wrong, because he could very well still be good with how similar the top lane meta is right now.
Jungle: He still finished 3rd in well LCS split while being considered the second best jungler, and then finished 6th after a solid split of being first for most of it, until they were 3rd going into playoffs when the entire team crumbled into shit.
Mid: Stage doesn't only include LCS, he played in a few tournies iirc, and he's been "on" stage as the coach of SK gaming who was just about the 2nd best team in europe for two splits straight with jesiz and candypanda.
 Him being an ass was also longer ago than zoro last played competitively, yet one is relevant and the other not?
ADC: I'm gonna disagree on calling rekkles better, and forg1ven I do consider better but not much, as he's said tabzz has been his greatest opponent.
I remember the grand duelist jax skin charity sale back then, wonder if rito would to the same again.
no.
 it's much better than it was.
 now melee teams can compete against full ranged teams.

I don't know, for the moment it's pretty fun, kinda like how poro king was.
 Though, It's a little too hectic and I think it needs to be nerfed/changed a bit to make it more balanced
Yea i would argue dexter was the second best player on that lemondogs team to Zoro
What they could do is drop her base damage values and up her ratios.
 Do the same for her stun -- make it 0.
5 seconds with an extra 0.
25 seconds per 100AP (numbers pulled out of my ass).
 That gives her a much greater need for AP, which she won't get a lot of as support.
 It would also nerf her early game as a solo laner, but she's already safe enough that I don't think it would hurt her too much.
okay this got.

YES!
 I think Riot should really get out there and do this more.
 Summoners helping the world through buying skins.
 100/10 good idea.
i gained +10 and lost -31 soooooo not fixed
Let's speak about auto-relegation instead.
 I just want all teams to be better than Dignitas.
 That Fusion/D series was too much to handle.
 If they aren't better than Dignitas, I'm going to hate this split.
Business isn't placing a skin pack that obviously anyone would buy considering they do it with anything they produce.
 Business is marketing a skin that not only will constantly provide a cash flow but be renowned by the community.
Greatness isn't based on solo kills and mechanical outplays.
Where did I say that they weren't?
 Stop drawing conclusions that were never there to begin with.
Shiphtur hasn't been hyped up as some scrim god by anyone recently.
 Maybe back in 2014 but not recently.
Link is Link.
 Good in low pressure, chocks in high pressure.
That sounds great, my ping is stable.
 Just at a constant 108 when I have 40 ping in other games that have east coast servers
how do you know its speculation.
 what are you supposed to say after you leak a lineup?
 "OH SHIT GUYS I WAS JUST KIDDING DONT TELL ANYONE"
Best to just fill if you know you're capable in any role, if theres a moron on your team let them play their best role and dont start a fight before you've even loaded the game because it will become impossible
Top - Zac, Mundo, Teemo, Garen
Jungle - Amumu, Warwick, Udyr
Mid - Annie, Ryze, Lux, Vel'koz
Adc - Ashe, Caitlyn
Support - Sona, Soraka, Blitzcrank
For builds just tell him to use the recommended, and remind him about his actives!
He is weak early due to being melee, He is also only good if ahead, He also only have one direction and that is in.
But hey he is fun and that is why I play him :> He is fine in soloQ because it is soloQ 
I love this game.
 I have no problem supporting Riot with money.

Almost half of the Korean pros have inactive mains
Best idea so far.
 Well done.
Anything is possible with King Rammus.

 My bronze ass.
 I'd probably do better against the NFL than I would against the LCS.
meh, I am lazy and suck with my presentation of my ideas.
 in other words i suck with words.
 lol.
yay can't wait master.
Shen would fit this model better.
 also could use a rework to hold up against that Zed rivalry.
Sorry , i'm kinda new on reddit ^^
It's fixed right now
The yoga looks like it only has 2 Gigs of RAM and a processor with 2M cache and 1.
3 Gigahertz.
Pretty sure even with a fan you couldn't play the game not to mention at 40 fps.
The game uses more than 2 gigs of RAM and the processor is really bad for gaming.
What is this "Mastery System" that everyone keeps asking for?
 More Riot vapor-ware?
 I'd rather have the chroma packs.
 How cool will it be when there are enough for your entire team to have matching colors in a game?
would main kennen for that only reason
jack himself told one writer that yusui did fantastic in scrims so far.
 Other people have been told the exact scrim results and thats how they are able to say what happened
The Rekkles to Fnatic article in my mind seals the deal that all this nonsense about Rekkles/Incarnati0n to SK is just that.
 nonsense.
my friend is a season tickets holder in one of the box seats and He took me, IT WAS GLORIOUS!
 then another friend of mine's dad got glass seats.
Not.
 Eing as good as he once was is to be expected.
 He was god tier and is out of practice.
 But again, we dont know how hell perform on a competative level.
 Neither do the pros, its all speculation.
 Other pros have said hes amazing again.
 We wont know unt hes on the stage, and there is literally jo point to speculate.
 Its all based on he said she said.
 No evidence
honestly i don't understand these fucking posts.
 If this was any other professional sport underperforming players would be instantly benched.
 If a player does not play as well as the standards set by his peers, he shouldn't be a paid professional.
 Fnatic will do what they think will give them the best chance to win worlds as an organization.
Sneaky is most definitely top 10 in the world right now
I like it.
 It's good for melee champions.
 I think plenty would agree 
Thoooooooorin fanboy.
Fnatic have plenty of picks, saying they don't is a flat out lie.
 Huni plays several champs at a must ban level such as Rumble/Hecarim.
 So does reign over and febiven.
 The only reason they would lose is by lanes and team fighting, as most of the other teams have players that are just straight up better.
No clue why you used EDG as an example for beating them.
 If anything, Skt will pummel FNC.
 They have faker and Bang, both on different levels than febiven and steelback.
 However Febiven may have a chance as he did play well in his region, but there's no telling.
 There's no clear cut winner for MSI so you shouldn't make accusations like that.
3k+ ARAMs played.
 I'm 100% fine with BT and Warmogs.
 The Mark/Dash is a really bad addition imo.
 Its not very fun for me atm and I'de prefer poke champs over what we currently have.
 I keep trying to see positive things about it and keeping an open mind but so far after 15ish games I 90% dislike it.
Gives a free bush check, insane vision even if you miss, more dps than ignite, uninterrupted, extremely fast gap close, and a short CD.
 It feels extremely gimmiky and thats why I was ok with it in Poro King despite me not liking that gamemode much.
 Now that its in perm ARAM(the gamemode I play the most by far) I'm pretty displeased for now.
 Maybe I'll grow to like it but I truly think it just turns ARAM into a shitshow 
It's just HyperX
you like dick
What happened was Fiora activated her ult, akali went into bubble and Fiora kept doing her ult, but did no damage.
Stay salty, salty adc main.
This is the most retarded post I've ever read, to the point where it must be satire but if you're serious:
> Is that enough?
You say this as though your one point is conclusive proof, and even then your one point is "probably has EU offers", and his only known offer is C9, which is a tryout.
> Or how about Yusui showing ok mechanics, but can also do quite poorly vs other weak challenger teams.
 While Incarnation is showing of some insane mechanics and outplays everytime he plays

 They aren't getting the RP because I won't be paying money for the points to buy something I don't plan to use.
 I appreciate the condescension but it wasn't really necessary.
Something something owner manager true relegation king run every lineup he's had into the ground
Tell that to 2 times MVP Steve Nash.

A lot of people also don't seem to realise that Gilius likes to troll, he literally could of wrote it knowing it would appear on Reddit and knowing it's wrong.
This is true.
 Honestly if he started using different sounds at the end of every video, I wouldnt be surprised.
Hawaii is a US state?
I like the lucian and lee ones.
 Pretty nice hope they do others for the other champs, wish they would lower the price or let me buy single ones but I really do not care.
 Riot is a business and they need to make money, rather they do this option practice than some other form of monetization that is an actually problem and we are forced to deal with.
> Sorry you had to go through **that**, OP
huehuehue
Aerial Ace, Fury Cutter, Quick Attack, Swords Dance.
Good Scyther moveset?
To be fair they sort of got caught up trolling WE with the Yasuo comp and that gave WE a fair bit of momentum.
"Yasuo is science"
Annie Q aswell :(
Once you start appreciating to fill, despite peoples antics or tricks to get the role they want, you'll have a lot more fun playing this game.
Ah, the young social liberal crowd here won't approve.
 Anyone care to disagree?
 I've yet to meet a single person that enjoys playing with foreigners that come to the NA servers.
 At least 99% of them are toxic, and the 1% that aren't, also hate the foreign players because they're so damn common that they give everyone a bad name.
I wanna give you gold but alas, I is poor
I said one of the few.
Riven is another one of the few
Mmm he had one bad game against Fusion, played well the other two.
 Dunked Dignitas in two games.
 Then had three different scrim blocks vs TSM and overall he played well vs Bjergsen, they both traded winning lane throughout the blocks.
.
oh, wait.
 It's soloqueue.
 You do.
Only the last part of the ult applies AoE fear.
 You can ult through someone without fearing them.
But why am I getting a that notifcation if I didn't actually verbally abuse someone.
I don't mind paying for them.
I do mind paying so damn much for them.
Do you guys not realize they had a survey go out and people said yeah i'd pay for that
Alright I didn't know that.
 I thought it was coming from riot telling me to not be toxic, when I clearly wasn't
Who cares?
 Stop spamming reddit.
I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment, I said previously that I believe the idea that China is a stronger region is correct.
 As much as people would like to deny it, they've consistently had more teams in the finals/semis of major international tournaments than the western regions.
 I do believe that the head to head results are also important and point to the top teams from both regions being more competitive with each other.
Maybe it's just me but i feel like the new combat text will play into a better death recap
Anyone know how to choose which chroma you want to use?
 There isn't an option in champ select.
Thank god im not the only one who builds hurricane on jinx o.

EDIT: Sorry it looks like the turret shot was another rocket, i guess im the only one then :'(
"Ahri Support is a thing"
-Bronze 1 playing normals
bork rush was fine, the purpose of it was to give you tools to snowball.
 trist after finishing bork was a super bursty assassin (by adc standards), with w bork active e r + a couple autos you could burst someone super hard and get a reset to jump out.
 especially in teamfights if anyone got chunked you could execute them very easily.
also it gave you sustain in lane to compete against the bt rush meta.

If you don't upvote or comment much, then my point still stands that the general "opinion" of this subreddit doesn't represent you, since you take no part in it by either commenting or upvoting.
 The numbers of active people (either way) is vastly inferior to the total sub count, and even the total sub count is a small portion of the actual game's playerbase.
That would be a very impressive bug!
Lol, that's awkward
After dealing with Nexon I realized how great Riot is.
 ;_;
Now I shall proceed to spend hundred of dollars on skins I'll never play.
Had a similar game in twisted treeline hexakill.
.
.
We won 98kills to 103.
 If I remember right.
 It was almost 2 hours long.
Long story short, the pushed to our base slowly over a hard fought game.
 I respawned in time to lux ult a triple kill and save base, then get a double a little too long after to get my penta as we pushed them off.
 and slowly, but surely pushed to their base ftw.
 Hands down the longest most intense game I've ever played.
What kind of person hunts other people down on reddit to talk shit lol.
I think this one is the most offensive.
Wait you can't already gift Chromas?
 Yeah that should be a no-brainer.
It wil be much better than your 20 FPS crappy laptop, Im not quite sure what frame rate you will get but with that graphics card around 60-100 FPS
if incarnation really is that good, he will want to go to C9 and C9 will want him.
 Think about it, this dude is coming off 3 years of bans almost, and now he has the chance to play on a top 3 western team.
 Why would he go to 4th place SK who's probably losing their star ADC and not even getting rekkles instead?
O_o?
can you not read?
you HAVE TO BUY shit first
you are buying FULL SKINS which cost MORE RP than chroma packs
this would make riot MORE money
wut?
How am I wrong?
 Lmao Even challenger Zeds cant beat a mid Varus so thanks for trying to be a smart guy, lool.
Yeah it seems good on paper.
 It's not very gold efficient though and really expensive.
mallet is super expensive for what it is.
Why would the cait ult the amumu
I feel like you're lying.
 Because I heard Sneaky say they can't really expect a new player in the team to become a shotcaller.
>When Overdrive ends, Blitzcrank is slowed by 30% for 1.
5 seconds.
redditors are butthurt
it didn't work *with rekkles*
On purpose or accidental?
The point is we don't know and jumping down someone's throat about something we aren't even sure about is pretty crappy.
Altec is shit anyways
No; He's a croc.
It's hard to say between the overlapping regions.
 I'd say he's the best midlaner in NA.
 As for EU, xPeke might still be better but they haven't matched up in ages.
 PoE and Feb1ven are good but a lot more inexperienced.
 Fox and Soren are solid, but not good enough to match up with Bjergsen.
I agree.
 Wfx deserved to get shit on for being trash.
 A bad team gets relegated.
 Geegee was pretty impressive even after all the praise altec got for being a godlike farmer.
 But getting 300cs and not carrying means all of fuck
Probably the starting mid for most game in the finals.
 Also, Easyhoon may go to CJ after CoCo goes to China (VG)
It is just like the very best in the world and as they move to different teams it is somewhat of a big deal.
 Like if Messi were to switch teams.
 Except you see it more often because each team has their own fans and people they think are the top in the world.
i think 1min CD would be fair 20 seconds is way to short It's a constant brawl it sucks for heavy mana users.
EDIT Immobile mages also are heavily effected by this also being on a short cd.
Why would you even think about running ghost on teemo?
even rekkles said that he played not well that split.
 i mean if the player himself admits that how can people still argue.
but i would expand that to a top3 seeing how hjarnan stepped up his game huuuge
Racism isn't a joke.
Please sell chromas individually.
 I would much rather buy one chroma than be forced to buy 3 at a time.
 It also gives us the option to get really cheap skins which would be very nice.
 I don't even care if it's like 250 per chroma and the bundle gives you a better price.
I really just want the flexibility to buy one thing at a time.
 Chromas are a really cool opportunity, and it's a shame to waste that by forcing them into bundles.
 I would be equally unhappy if I had to buy 3 normal skins to get the one I want.
On top of that, he did it with a fuck ton of different champs
championsuggest: na Saphrogenik 
You're completely dumb or?
Group C: SSB was the second best team in the world.
LMQ has been number 1 in NA for the whole split before playoff.
 Got problems in playoff and ended 3rd NA, but should have been n°1 at the time.
And OMG was still really good.
Anyway, I'm not even the one saying it was group of death.
 But if you think group D was the hardest, just let me laugh.
Group D: Kabum, worst korean who attended because of a lucky spree, 3rd stronger NA, very unstable Alliance .
 Yeah, seriously, just shut up.
The hell?
 Those Nemesis Jax and Pool Party Leona Chromas?
 Why do they cost that much?
because he can already stick to people, has a terrible build path, is not very cost effective, is expensive
Wtf dude stop e-stalking him.
He was contracted.
 Wish I could link it, but it's a Richard article and it'll just get deleted :/.
They have a monopoly of possibly the largest free to play game in the world.
 They could release a summoner icon of my asshole for 1000 rp and it will sell well.
Voting with your wallet is meaningless when you're dealing with giant successes like league of legends.
 That's why wizard crab agrees with you.
 That's the ideal way for you to protest for them.
 You quietly don't do anything.
 They don't have to worry about negative publicity that comes when a community gets angry or the protest spreading as others hear about why you're not making the purchase and affecting their own decision.
 You just stand aside and do nothing while they sell what they want for whatever price they want.
Its a bug.
 Bugs are inevitably gonna happen in any game.
Noxian Diplomacy
Just watch how they play their games out and you will see their failings.
 Laning is the least of their problems.
 It's stupid to generalize CLG as one team when they have had almost never ending roster changes.
 When they play it's actually like they forgot how to carry out of their roles.
 They try to roam too much or constantly group and a lot of the time it ends up backfiring on them.
 They never seem content to just ward up and play their lanes out.
 All of their problems seem to mostly be fixed with practice and I don't see a reason why they couldn't be top performers next split with their current roster.
why do i have the feeling that whatever PoE plays in midlane gets used by bjergsen soon after (to great effect too, no question)
Right on the money.
 Especially for top western teams.
 Almost if by supporting Fnatic and TSM you automatically believe huni is top 5 in the world or Bjergsen will beat Faker (Thoorin likes to use this one).
Support your favorite team?
 "Why would you?

hi can you delete ur post?
Two reasons why they aren't picking up Alex Ich: 
1: Alex Ich has his own team (Misfits).
2: Pobelter and Altec have stated that they are sticking together no matter what.
Comment ignored due to lack of intelligence.
Judging by your butthole comment you probably talked shit in the game 
>that should be free
why should it be free, just wondering
Sooooooo.
 here goes.
Phreak--been a fan since I started playing.
 Used to watch you stream before streaming was a thing (#getonmylevel).
 Was STOKED when you got picked up by Riot.
 Played an arranged 5s once with you and some Teamliquid (the forum, before they had an actual League subforum, much less a team) where you took Soraka top and just afk push-fed waves until you took an inhibitor.
Hey Jatt.
 We met once when you came to Hawaii ([Imgur](http://i.

com/q77OF47.
jpg)).
 Been a fan since you were on Rock Solid.
 Looked up to you as a jungler.
 Still have a screenshot of playing against some of the old Rock Solid members (Rambo, you, imaqtpie, poisonidon, and Voyboy) in ranked 5s.
 You went like 15/8 on Lanewick and almost carried singlehandedly ([Imgur](http://i.
imgur.
com/QeePLT9.
jpg)).
 I specifically remember us dying to you 1v3 in the bot lane that game, and our Caitlyn started raging at us.
 Coincidentally, he's now the analyst or coach for some team, I think.
 HUGE fan of your analyses and casting.
Kobe--Check it out, old screenshot too!
 ([Imgur](http://i.
imgur.
com/klEgx3k.
jpg)) I think I told you this right after you started casting, but I was incredibly impressed by your casting and analyses, and I continue to enjoy hearing you talk while I'm watching league.
 Keep up the good work man!
And.
 Rivington.
 Soooo I used to hate on you a lot.
 Like, a LOT.
 Probably because I heard some rumors about someone we both know.
 I was very vocal and adamant about how much I hated your casting--but that's changed.
 It feels like you put in a LOT of work getting better at casting.
 I genuinely like listening to you cast now.
 Sometime earlier this year or last I got to play a game with you through a mutual friend (you had your mic off half the time and didn't realize it lol) and you played really well, and I was impressed by that, too.
 So, hey, man, the reason I posted this was mainly for you.
 I'm not sure if you ever saw any of the posts I made, but if you did, I apologize.
 I can tell you put in a ton of work and I think you're doing a great job now.
 Good luck in the future!
Sjokz/Deficio/Quickshot--NA > EU FOREVE--just kidding.
 I like the three of you, as well!
 I just don't have any stories to share.
 Riot's doing a great job with the quality of the broadcasts and their personalities, so keep up the good work ;).
Sincerely,
The Real Shitcombo
I've already made the drive from the springs to my hometown in FL.

Treyvon Martin Lucian.
 Complete with hoodie and skittles
if you're interested, there will be a event held next week, called MSI (mid season invitationals).
 All the top teams from world wide from each region, korean, china, wild card, eu, na, and i 4got the last one will be playing against each other.
 it'll give you a good idea why league is so popular even if you don't understand the game.
 Its really the fans that makes esports such a success (new generations).
 You can watch it on twitch streaming platform and any other streaming platforms most likely anywhere, on your phone, computer laptop etc as long as you got a decent connection.
if e-sports fan died out, then the players wouldn't be as popular similar to how a baseball stadium sometimes are almost empty and no one cares about watching it.
I mean if they main that role I'd prefer them to be where they're most comfortable, nothing sucks more getting stuck where you're at your worst and getting flamed for not doing good.
well if he tries that hard I guess I'd just have to give it to him
Slooshi on a team,
Yusui in tryouts for C9?
 So why are you even arguing for him,
Huhi in a team,
Bishu has left the scene so many times he probably got whiplash.
Heimerdinger needs to get to work!
Oh man there's a blood skin and a crip skin for lucian.
.
Someone that has nothing going for him is also viable.
You're.
 delusional.
The 2nd place EU LCS team got smashed by c9 3-0 in embarrassing fashion during that slump.
 SK was far and away the best EU team at the time and got smashed at IEM.
And again, 0-3 in groups at worlds before that.
 It's like EU fans manage to block out any actual facts, what players say, what analysts say, etc.
 to try and continue to believe this stuff.
Dont change my main blah blah
championsuggest: na GreenTomas
As much as I like SKT I hope they don't win worlds.
 That would be so lame, for a team to win 2 world championships when there has only been 5.
I was wondering this yesterday when I died to a blue square.
This.
 I only even bought the URF finisher icon because at least I got the Heart, and I really liked the design of the icon itself.
As for 250 RP, honestly, I feel, and have always felt, this is how much a ward skin should cost as is.
 Even 390 would be better than what it is now.
 But a ward skin being more expensive than even the cheapest of champions is absolutely ridiculous.
 I will never buy a ward skin at their current standard price.
 And I say this as someone who has a history of warding a *lot*.
It's just not worth it to pay the same amount for this little blob that I would for an entire character revamp.
it's at a point where mark is a MUST-HAVE summoner.
That's not the goal, that's op, and that's bad.
Oh stfu.
 If Riot unbans him, then that's good enough for C9.
 Why should he be punished for how he acted in a game as a dumb kid for this long, especially when he's not even like that anymore.
Proxy Singed is the reason killing minions increases you bounty when on a death streak :).
is Pawns problem actually entiritis?
 I thought it was back problems
LMAO, the fucking irony.
Very bad mistake, as we have seen the most Egoist ADC's have had very poor results in general; Chaox, Rekkles, Forgiven and Doublelift.
 Keep steelback or prepare to lose 1st place at EU.
Idk why Fnatic members or staff is stupid enough to take him back.
.
JUST in case people think her E is pass through
its not
it stops of first target hit
Rationally, if you can do equally well on another role and your goal is to win, it's in your interest to switch.
 But you don't have to.
Aw c'mon, you don't like Hired Gun's flame shooting?
People weren't mad at coast because they made a questionable/bad decision for themselves.
 They were mad at coast because it was 'unfair' to screw someone over like that.
TDK is doing the same thing here.
 The only difference is that here it's probably a good decision for them.
I also think that teams should only be looking out for themselves but you can't deny the hypocrisy here.
Well.
.
 it had a 50%ish winrate before they made that you worth gold again if you farm creeps.
 Also s3 singed was ridiciloud he'd 1 shot people while still being unkillable because you couldnt catch him
> Is everyone in ranked games amazing?
No, but they have gotten to level 30, which puts them far above a lot of the population.
 Using ranked queue as a random distribution is incredibly flawed, which is what that guy was trying to do.
So Annie no longer outranges Anivia and Ashe, and she’s on par with Varus and Zyra.
Buy the skin, there are players that love teams even tho they don't play anymore.
 I mean, after all is a team you like.
 I'd pay full price for a C9 ward and have it forever not just 1 split.
He even has an ability called "Mace of Spades".
.
Lol'd too hard at this comment.
CJ played significantly worse at IE than in the rest of the LCK, and they got much better after IEM.
 They very nearly beat SKT in the semis.
Do you think because there's a 975 (yes, 975!
!
!
) skin that is essentially a re-colour of Zac it makes some sort of evidence to the process being "easy"?
Yes, it's a shitpost.
fix´d
I mean Incarnation has said he wants to play with Rekkles
Queen* .
Yes Taric is that fabulous
They are going to fix them by never doing skins like that again, or updating when they get a VU.
Im betting Incarnation makes the team.
 He's more experienced.
 Yusui is still to young.
 I think he feels its just fun and games.
 I been watching his scrims, and I think he's infatuated with the idea of playing professionally, but 1nce he hits a speed bump he will go on total tilt fest.
 He's seems very rash, and needs to be trained, and almost raised from being a punk teenager, into young adult/man.
 I would say that sneaky, and Meteos are the young adults on the team, still with there childish tendancies and humor, but have the work ethic and maturity of a man.
 While Lemon is more of the man of the team, with great intuition, and Balls is the man that just goes balls to the wall, and doesnt say anything, 1 thing that they all had in common was the fact they were mature with eachother, I don't feel Yusui has learned how to do that yet.
Incarnation on the otherhand, I believe he has more than learned that, the hard way, more than 1nce.
 -his full history-
judging a team completely off how strong the players are in theory isnt exactly the most reliable way to judge a team.
this, just like elements last roster both have potential to win eu lcs and have a fair run at worlds but being able to reach that potential is the real difficulty
The fucking reporter who keeps leaking all the info about the transfers is the one who gave the info rofl.

It's all there.
I *really* don't think controversy made Thorin famous.
 He succeeded because he's an excellent interviewer, and Grilled put him in the spotlight in this community.
IMO, these thinly veiled jabs he's been spamming the :> face with are just cheap pandering, and he can do better as a journalist.
Not that I don't get cheap pandering.
 I just disagree that it's what makes him famous.
As an ADC main if there's one thing I'm grateful to riot for doing is reworking Nidalee.
 Support nida just fucking vanished out of the earth's surface and surprisingly enough I didn't lose that much games because of a rampaging top nida (back when she was the ad splitpush monster).
Honestly, I have had fun dodging (or trying to dodge) them and feel they really bring some needed champion diversity in ARAM.
 However, instead of nerfing the cd or range, can we simply make them more visible?
 Sometimes in the heat of a team fight, these tiny snow balls become more invisible than actually invisible bugged nidalee spears.
There's a difference between selling quality cosmetics that took time to make and shitting out reskins and making grabby hands at your wallet.
 Promoting the latter gives no incentive to bother with the former.
 I absolutely loathe "gold" skins for this reason (that and they universally look like gaudy shit)
Mystery skin gifting is a feature that shows up a couple times a year for a couple weeks at a time.

Sheer pushing power no.
 But saftey in splitpushing?
 Yeah, better waveclear (he build more AD and can one shot the wave) builds Ghostblade, which significantly helps splitpushing (can usually get a tower down during that time, which is like 6 seconds).
He is a better all around splitlushed and doesnt need full build.
 Just Ghostblade and Bork, which is part of his core build.
 Not to mention zed can deal eith other champions easier.
 Aatrox gets kited a lot easier than zed if they send an ADC to defend under the trret.
Aatrox literally has very little place in this meta.
 He needs buffed.
 Whatever you pick him for someone fits the job better.
 He has no niche and isnt good all around.
rito is getting deep on us.
why describe the horrific events that occurred pre-death?
you're dead.
 nothing matters anymore.
That walks through doors if he presses SELECT at the right time.
The no damage thing was always a drastic exaggeration by people who understood nothing about Naut or why he wasn't a strong pick; and it was mainly in relation to his jungling AND he was reliant on his W for damage.
 He lost against most junglers and once W is down your nothing.
For botlane, your W got a massive buff, so it doesn't break as easy, there isn't really massive damage early game, and you rely on E for more oomph anyway.
 Combine that with squishy and often immobile carries and or supports you have a much easier time throwing your anchor around.
Tactical Turtleneck
I'm still here for Diamond and Edward, I really hope they don't leave as well :(
Don't rush it, buy it when you would get a LW.
that feeling when 575 attack range is still higher than 80% of adc's.

[](/taric):Outrageous
And do people not remember his plays in the lcs.
 Full on s4 double lift.
 Take all his team's resources and farm all game.
 Throw the game away in ONE fight by mispositioning.
 I think altec is average at best.
No it's not.
 Faker is overrated as fuck, he's not the s3 faker where he got solo kills in lane every game.
 You clearly don't watch lck games.
Even having only some parts of the skin manipulated by the player can still result in loss of visual integrity.
 This is especially true for color blind players who can be overwhelmed be some color palettes very easily.
Yep, Swain wave clear is trash-tier terrible.
 You have to waste 1/4 of your mana to 'attempt' to wave clear with your R, and still fail.
 Skilled players camp him pre-6 and pick high wave clear champions against him for freelo.
 The only reason someone D5+ would ever pick Swain is to hard counter Vlad, and only in top-lane.
The word "Meta" in relation to League of Legends can be defined as: The most efficient way to currently play the game.
thats not a sword, its a spade.
 Like the spade you use to dig graves (lol yorick is gay now, he digs graves)

No, they are free.
 There is the option to spend money to buy them if you don't want to farm up ip.
 It's the same exact way League's champions are.
 You can buy with ip or rp.
yeah its awesome
But Pantheon, Shen and TF all do ping - as of this patch
Wow, he outfarmed Bjergsen in 1 out of 6 games, he must be so damn good, definitely top 2 NA and a good prospect for next worlds
"They made it to the semi-finals of Worlds" is another way of saying "They beat C9 in a Bo3 and did not win a series against an Eastern team.
"
Certainly the best Western International result since the start of the LCS (including TSM's recent IEM victory), but not super relevant in trying to find their ceiling with a mediocre ADC.
Oh, I came into it with a different view.
 I initially thought that you could by the colours separately, and when I noticed you did not it felt like I got two colours for free!
its only a spam fest on certain champs.

The point of blind pick is so that you do not know until in game what you are against.
 It would defeat the purpose of BLIND picking.
Actually it really should have been like 50 for 1, 120 for 3.
 If you know anything about graphic design you could make thirty of these in an hour.
 Not to mention this game's competitors give recolors out for free.
They always this way with words that make it seem like they are making you a favor.
Let's not forget that the chromas are absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel quality kind of "skins".
 There's a subreddit dedicated to showing that people are able to do the same thing in less than 5 min on photoshop.
 For free.

I honestly don't trust Rekkles.
 Why would the management team in Fnatic give him another chance?
 Steelback isn't bad, he performed fairly well.
 Why risk losing it all for someone like Rekkles who jumped boat at the first second when things don't go according to plan?
Don't fix what isn't broken.
 You saw what happened to Alliance when Alliance traded Tabbzz for Rekkles.
I know outclassing Huhi means you're basically faker
Okay fine.
Considering the expactations for Rekkles were to be godlike and for Steelback to perform above expactations really only meant that he didn't loose fnatic a lot of games.
Most people it seems.
Do you mean 'Sneak Peek'?

Something something condom sound effects joke
Yeah tank/hard engage champs usually just had to turtle for a bit until they could engage and soak up any damage.
I think mark is good and adds more depth to the game, but it needs some number tweaking to be balanced.
Well he did have a 54% winrate before the changes.
 Who knows when the clip was made
Let me check this for you.
It's weird that you are getting down voted, because I completely relate how you feel.
 Dash is a potent game-changer that created a completely different sense of pacing to the match.
Your non-use of English hurts my brain.
Plus, you're wrong.
Yeah I'm open to any suggestions you have for good ways to measure Top laner effectiveness numerically!
 It's a real challenge.
To be fair, and I'm not trying to hate on Dyrus, but his numbers are always going to look bad based on last split, partly because of how TSM used him (as bait on one side of the map while the rest of the team took advantages elsewhere).
 I don't think a different set of numbers would change that; you have to interpret Dyrus with a proper understanding of his team.
I also don't think Dyrus performed as well as he could have last split, but I acknowledge that the numbers don't tell his whole story.
I think he hasn't performed very well this season but imo he was very good in the season 4 summer split.
I was ready to shame him to.
 But to do that in masters is impressive.
I mean not everyone.
 It's obvious there are people that root for bad teams, but it's rare.
 So I'm assuming most people are TSM fans.
We don't even know if Incarnation will perform or not.
 I can understand why people would be excited to see him play but let's not get ahead of ourselves, he hasn't even played yet.
There is counterplay.
 If they flash onto you, just flash away.
These Pool Party Leona chromas are pretty fun, I might have to get that Iron Man Blitz
Top: Oh well.
 If we are living in the past i would go with Wickd, Diamond, Froggen, Forg1ven, Edward.
Jungle: Saying one player "made the team look goos" is just pathetic.
Mid: When?
 He was banned until today since the Qualifier for LCS split 1.
 He didn't.
 Also i am not saying he is an asshole.
 He has a toxic past and that is a potential risk.
 However Incarnati0n is the least crazy name on that list IMO.
 A Superteam hast to be prooven tho.
ADC: He is clearly above average.
 But he is clearly below Forg1ven and Rekkles (only if he finds bis form with Yellowstar again obviously).
Support: .
Didn't he win worlds strongest man?
j/k
But I Like this quote from the wiki entry:
>Carlsen was later coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[10] who in turn cites Norwegian football manager and Egil "Drillo" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.
So you're saying that you regard your meaningless karma so much that you make this post.
 Interesting.
to be fair.
 yellowstar going roaming/help reignover warding fits rekkles perfectly as he likes to just farm botlane
I have to agree, won't be long before you can get a pink skin every champion.
bolofoo you cheeky cunt
^^^^yusuiTHIRST
This was pretty much my only complaint about the chromas.
 Back in the day, a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the "bucket fill" option.
I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together.
 Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each.
Its like people on video game auctions.
 You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item.
 The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50.
So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.
Same applies here.
 Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing.
 This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.

He's not bad, he has a 53% win rate in Plat+ solo queue
hes a melee assassin, hes gonna have a hard time in lane, but his strength is being able to roam well and burst carries very easily once he hits 6, Bjerg might have been talking about competitive play but Talon is a fine solo queue pick

Okay, so I don't know if any of you were here when she came out, but her first sneak peek had this.
 It was basically Lee Sin passive.
 They said that it would be too low-risk for a ranged carry to be able to do this.
 And this passive was alone without the damage.
 And this is still correct, especially with the ward changes (long ago).
 So I think this a very bad idea.
 It would discredit Lee Sin (though this has not stopped anything before), provide needless utility on a champion who is in a fine place, give another dual passive that isn't needed, and making her probably more of a support due to the large vision control.
 I agree she may need some buffs, but these are not the ones she needs.
You'r saying two Tristana mains should date?
 What would Teemo and Rumble mains think!
?
Ruined aram for me, never playing it again.
,
Same.
 I really like the blue and red though.
 Haven't tried yellow yet.
.
It'd be badass if the splash art changed depending on the color selected, but I bet that will never be a reality
yeah, but the way you worded it was weird.
 You said thank you for taking consideration for "future projects", which infers that you didn't think that riot took chromas into consideration in the first place.
This is very well written and correct, all of your points are great points.
 But they can always bring steelback back onto the team if things are not as great as they were, that may hurt the teams play a little bit but I still believe its worth it.
I do applaud Fnatic for making a risky decision most teams wouldn't, alot of teams are too afraid to roster swap when they are winning and even when they are losing (ex: CLG keeping Link and not even looking over other options after playoffs).
he's his brother
exactly what I just said in a comment!
 you sir are correct!
 great minds think alike
new minions don't have textures like that, these are old
While many people likely do embellish when talking about their rank (and in some cases, I can't blame them, because *other* people will rip you apart for not being Challenger if you dare have an opinion they disagree with), the more serious a league player someone is, the more time they probably spend on LoL-related stuff even when they are not playing.
 By being invested enough in the game to achieve a high rank, the likelihood that they are also engaged in the LoL community goes up somewhat.
 Contrary to that, random bronzies are *far* more likely to never actually read anything online about League or study the game, and just play it the 3-5 hours a week that they play.
 Also, by learning stuff through the LoL community resources and guides and stuff, their game knowledge will go up, which increases the chance that shitter players will improve more quickly than their peers and actually achieve higher ranks.
Nice!
You might be right, even though it doesn´t has to be Ao Shin.

 Damn, I got downvoted because reddit people are crap at knowing how internet works xD
Vulcun was a wicked fucking good team wtf.
I wrote this idea without seeing it was posted already, yes I think it's the best idea yet, and about 1K is a good idea too, something similar to the gardian's horn.
Reddit doesn't listen to what Riot actually says.
 Like the recolour poll that was out a while ago yet everyone apparently missed it yet I got it on all 3 of my alts.
marin had some bad games in the middle and beggining of this split when he had low impact too.
 im not saying he's not one of the best top laners in the world, but is not top 3 for sure.
koro1 has been playing like a beast, especially in team fights during the whole season.
 he was 18-0 on gnar before playoff i think.
i mained rumble for a fair bit i still consider him to be a go to for me when i play top lane and i noticed this bug but if you pay closer attention to the skill shot indicator or cast tool, you'll actually notice that the lines that dictate the width of the equalizer actually start to fade in and the equalizer's first explosion begins where the width indicators begin.
 i can see your frustration but it is something that is easy to adapt to.
 test it in a custom or just rewatch your video you'll understand :)
championsuggest: na Koreantoucan
You need to think of something how to measure top lane impact other than cs difference and damage output.
 Obviously stats don't tell the whole story at any position, but for top it's quite obvious.
 I might be biased, but I feel a player like Dyrus for instance looks much worse through that scope despite being always at least top 3.
Kennen replaces Annie, Naut replaces Blitz, good
It's such a roulette with SHR.
 It just happened that they won the gamble in that tournament.
 I always want to compare SHR to KT Arrows during summer 2014.
 They play super aggressive, and their highs are so high, but their lows are so low.
 It just happens that SHR had a good run like how KT Arrows had a good run during OGN Summer 2014.
But If he's bug-steel, he'll recive x4 fire damage.
and do you think talon in some point can get better than zed?
 i mean after some LoL changes?
I remember (I can't talk about omg cause I didn't watch) But I did say in my last post that its one factor including synergy which I heard was a problem for omg but I didn't watch so idk.
Elements on the other hand had other problems.
 Top lane being one.
 if we look at talent Froggen didn't have the best year.
 The type of players they had also weren't working in the Meta.
I agree talent isn't everything I do however think its probably one of the most important things now that MOST teams are catching up at shotcalling and map movement which is why C9 can't beat TSM anymore with Hai (I love hai though) 
Ethical?
 They made a product.
 It doesn't hurt anyone.
 It's up for you to consume or not consume.
 I don't see any ethical problem there.
I'm a chronic insomniac who's too tired to think well right now, and before I realized it I'd written a lengthy rant about how people need to stop bitching that they're not gonna be able to buy chromas for free basically.
 The games free to play, and not pay to win, cosmetics are their primary means of making money, so people should really stop trying to act like they're being subtle, reasonable, and presenting a valid point with these threads which have been clogging the subreddit, and inevitably hi-jacking any topic even related to chromas into a circle jerk where these whiny bitches try to convince the community, and by extension RIOT, that they deserve free cosmetics as well because they played enough hours of this game that cost them nothing that they somehow deserve it.
 I'm poor, I won't be buying chromas either, but I'm not pissed that RIOT's making money, I'm glad they're succeeding at providing quality entertainment for free, and "fans" need to quit being ungrateful little shits.
 I don't even remember what set me off but I think that was the gist of it.
Common sense and a brain, they say it has Ultra high HD graphics, might over heat your pc.
i see no use of spades, like pulse might be out of date, but damn least it doesnt look fake af compared to spades lol 
will a fan do?
?
?
 its SSD .
I NEED NOURISHMENT!
Okay, so an ADC with 550 range, stealth, a low cooldown dash, and a knockback can't deal damage without dying.
i was playing one solo normal.
 We were winning, lead in kills, got 2 inhibitors guess what?
 They voted to surrend and it passed.
 I had no words.
.
I wouldn't want to get paid in chickens either, even if I got to play on Elements.
Dammit!
 You evil genius
only the sides of his ult will fear and damage guys
Because Ezreal is a cool dude.
 He's my favorite champ so I got all his skins.
I would go with Freddy or Odoamne, Sven, Febiven, Forg1ven/Vander or Rekkles/Yellowstar.
If you want to play to win lane take botlane1 if you want to be less ADC centric go with botlane2.
Note that individually i think Forg1ven and Yellowstar are the best at their roles - however their playstyle is to different.
that was pretty painful to watch
Not even just the mids lol
Yusui really isn't that talented though man.
 He's pretty good, but that's all.
Cause being a 3rd world contry really got in the way of LAS and LAN.
And why would it matter that they aren't paying in Reais?
 RP costs have been 'leveled' when they changed it, meaning every server pays roughly the same amount to get x RP.
people actually follow that stupid ranga fuck?
ok, i was kind of assuming since more people live on the east coast that theres potentially a well of untapped potential in terms of player base.
 but you could be right about both servers becoming weaker.
How the hell you think wxw was better?
 Hai dumpstered him many times.
 Remember his khazix games ?
[No body wants to gift me anymore](https://imgflip.
com/s/meme/First-World-Problems.
jpg)
Maybe sending Riot a support ticket with your PC specs and game settings would be more helpful in resolving this bug then coming to reddit.
I really hope they don't add Yusui.
 NA mid laners seem to have this problem of being gods in scrims and sucking in any high pressure situation.
It's hype because of his insane mechanics.
Because he's made to duel and push.
 Generally top lanes are pushers while junglers have to roam around and commit to ganks and teamfights.
 Aatrox can teamfight moderately well, but he's not as tanky as the top picks.
 However, Aatrox can push down an inhib turret and the inhib behind it while the rest of the enemy team tries to teamfight.
yes, with longer range too, iirc.

Clearly you have not played on EU servers.
 Everyone is speaking a different language, all the time!
what if somebody buys chromas on EUW for example and transfers to brazil?
this differs from person to person, someone need at least 1 week to adjust for jet lag, some people might just need one night
Sorry, this is fake man.
 Poppy doesn't have enough mana for all those spells.
Leviathan was free.
 Wtf ?
He would be Closer to home, still has 2 great players in Sven and Freddy.
 Already knows the org as he coached them in the past.
 Friends nearby to support him.
 Let's not pretend that SK is shit all the sudden because they "only" became fourth.
Yet only one of the two people get banned.
Hint: it is not the one that you can deal with within the game itself
Hjarnan is also the brain of his team, its impressive.
Mind explaining how spellblade stacking works?
 I would love it if there was a way to do that.
it's faker
Anybody see the irony?
> explaining us that a chroma recolour skin took him about 1 hour or something
Yeah, and it ended up looking downright terrible.
but why not Bischu?
RIP that in-store Best Buy ad with HotshotGG.
The one time "Literally Game Breaking" could have been the title.
 you missed it man
Are you honestly trying to claim LMQ was better than C9 when C9 was 3-1 over them during their shaky regular season split?
 Ackerman was on full fucking tilt at worlds too, LMQ was worse than ever, what a joke.
I think skt will win but GE have an upper hand since they've seen skt play these past few weeks and GE hasn't played in sometime.
gg this means ge tigers will win bcuz lcs is scripted like wwe, thx 4 spoiler rito

Can I ask what will happen to the champs who have recolors/"chormas" as skins already?
 Skins like Emerald Taric, Swampmaster Kennen, Nightmare Cho'Gath.
 It is a bit ridiculous that they would remain the same as cheaper alternatives for other champs are released.
 Is there a plan to chafe this over time?
I keep hearing "well it was bad at the time" and i still have no idea what changed that made it good
Well, physical attributes can always be gained.
 You can get muscle/weight depending on whichever you need, just not the height.
 The problem is the skill aspect.
 Someone could go work out and become just as muscular and big as a professional athlete would, but they'd get destroyed in the mechanical aspect of the game.
 Shooting the basketball, handling it, how to read body movements, etc.
 Or in football - how to throw and catch properly.

Yeah but he should exert a certain fear/authority as in "If I dont listen to him it will have consequences" Obviously it would be ideal if the coach was a guy everyone in the team looks up to and would listen to out of their own will and not because they have to but where do you find that for a team which consists of veterans?
championsuggest: na jack limestone
Fury of the Sands
I have a weird feeling like they wont because its possible they could make more money off of new zac "skins" or basically overpriced chromas
I think that's the critical difference he is making, "difficult but possible by a slim margin" versus "actually impossible".
Steelback got a lot of exposure.
 He played solid, but arguably he is the weakest link on the team and Rekkles is a better player.
 He seems like a top tier challenger team ADC and I hope he can find another team but it would be foolish not to take Rekkles (assuming that he is willing to make it work and everything, but objectively Rekkles seems like the better player)

 This was back when CLG used to just be a protect the DL comp.
 Also, if i remember correctly this was back when Wildturtle just came of the scene and was dumpstering people with it.
 Other pros like cop starting picking it up and DL was asked his opinion of it, to which he said "Draven is trash.

 with out team i would much rather pick a hypercarry like trist or kog" (paraphrased quite a bit) which is completely right, a hypercarry is much better pick than draven in a protect the ad comp

OMG beat Star Horn in two BO5s in their Playoffs with a worse support player.
 SHRC only got second seed because they beat OMG in a BO3 at Regionals.
 Overall, OMG had a better record in best-of series going into the matchup with a downgraded roster.
 It was a weird thing, and apparently internal arguments between Cloud and Loveling cost them an engage when Game 3 was more or less won.

I hope almost all of you watch the ADCL everyday on twitch because I am there every day talking in twitch chat and calling out their bot / top lane on a dialy basis for being bad.
This is not new.
 Misfit relies too heavily on Alex and Crumbzz.
 Their bot lane simply isn't on par and neither is their top laner to even low level LCS teams.
And against C9T even if Alex plays as best as he can it isn't enough because their bot / top lane are just not good enough even in comparison to low level LCS teams at the moment.
 Can this change in the future sure.
 a lot of things can change but right now this is where they are at.
I don't think they want to make a zac skin that takes away his squishy, blobby stretchiness, its too core to his identity, like a sons skin with no music device thing.

Some people want them, but don't want to pay for them.

If you're going to say "If you're winning with mages, it's just luck," I'm going to say "If you're losing to Mark/Dash, you're just bad.
" The projectile is slow and the damage is low enough that frontliners can happily body block it all day.
 If you're squishy and you know the enemy team has a Mark/Dash Galio then don't be an idiot and run around way in front of your team.
Would they add to his total hp of bloblets or only the bloblet that hit it?
People have been asking for a better item path for a while.
 Riot would have to figure out how to implement the AD + mana per hit item properly or it could make certain champs completely op as a first quick part buy.
Not a bad idea just needs to be implemented carefully.
how did you watch the scrims?

This is a big thing.
 SKT had to put out A LOT of their big strats out there to get through CJ.
 I think it was one of the SKT players being interviewed after the game, he said that GE was in a really good position because they had no clue what to prepare for while GE knew exactly what to prepare for.
People are expecting SKT to roll through them (just like people expected SKT to roll through CJ funny enough), but I think it'll be a close series.
I just realised, 55 armor at lvl 1 is huge!

 O one more thing, did you try it out with other varus skins?
 I can see that the artic ops one would be the best though because the Blue from the arrows blends nicely with the water.

 People from here making a collective decision not to buy chroma packs will have a very small effect on how much money they make from them, if any at all.
thank you.
 it's amazing the amount of people on here who feel like this sub's opinion reflects the entire player base
I don't speak for reddit nor do I want to sound like I do.
 I've seen people talk about Vardags being better than Hjarnan, or Hjarnan not standing out like Forgiven or Freeze.
 I don't agree with it, but people have differing opinions and I wanted to state mine that's all.
I would totally grab new BC on Sivir because she can proc it semi-easily like Lucian and with her passive the move speed is godlike.
 Not to mention the extra health would be nice.
 But agreed that it's a little expensive without giving proper stats for an adc.
 Bouncing back to the plus side though cdr is amazing on Sivir.
 I love to go for max.
 QQQQQQQQQQQ
You aren't mean dw 
If you are going to try new champs, at least have the decency to look at the skill set of the champion.
 Better yet, go read a guide, look up what pro players build on that champion, find videos from pro players' stream, do some theory craft, think about what skills you will max first/what items you will build.
 Don't go into a match completely unprepared.
 You can also try the champion in custom match(there are almost always some all blind all mid custom games hosting)/dominion/play against your friends in custom games/play on pbe.
That's good of you to respect others' opinions unlike many who insult everyone who disagrees with them.
LCS not so good tho, watch the asians play.
i dont own ezreal
Ill pay for the chromas if the dollahs goes towards a new client in my lifetime.
.
 who am i kidding.
.
 probably gonna get the blue lucian one anyway cause i like to be stylin.
.
 rip money.
If you're saying make it an option they choose, that wouldn't work, they usually don't think they're retarded, if you just mean upgrade chat restriction to 0 messages a game they won't do that since if they haven't banned them, they're still giving them a chance.
Gillius doesnt even know.
 He said right after that this was just speculation.
Generic questions get generic answers.
Individual stats don't tell much, and as you know individual stats do not win games, if you find yourself doing really well every game yet losing, (excluding an afk player) then you might be doing something wrong.
 The only generic answer I can give you is that you gotta take a leadership role on the team, you need to ping objectives, remind dragons, ping a player when he is about to go in a bad situation, there is really just to many things, watch streams, narrow your champion poll, don't play late late night, take a break after tilts, I mean I could probably write 1,000 things here.
I think one thing I liked the most was I think something Dyrus said, "find out what you suck at, what your bad at", found out your mistakes, watch your matches over, then apply that knowledge.
I wont be wasting my money on them.
 This would of been a perfect IP dump especially when you spend RP for the skin already or given away through mastery system.
If i really wanted to change the color of my champ i would spend 10 minutes in photoshop and do it myself.
 Then i get to make the skin look the way i want.
 Honestly they should be allowing us to edit the skin with a color editor.
Ah thats right now I remember him.
 Thanks.

Because he never declined an offer as a starting player, what makes you think he never declined an offer as a sub?
> It's not a sport, they're just SUPER delusional.
 So all the repsonses you'll get will reflect that delusion.
 They're just guys who are good at a video game.
Ok the major difference between an Esport such as this, and a Sport such as Footbal (american) is Physcal contact, vs playing on a computer.
 Esport pro's, put in just as much practice time, if not more as far as training goes, to keep there reflexes sharp, there stradegies on point, and there game mechanics up, just as a NFL superstar would practice to keep there stamina, reflexes and learning new plays, designed by the coach (which btw, just like in the NFL, these LoL teams have full coach and analyst staff to analyze other teams stradegies, and work with the coach in creating new stradegies to beat the old ones, never ending evolution, just like football).
So were basically talking about the difference between physcally playing an active game, or playing a game that is controlled via mouse and keyboard.
 Yes, Active games require weight lifting, endurance and stamina, strength, incredible skill.
 On the other hand, Video games require incredible reaction speed, incredible skill, great attention span.
 Both require good teamwork.
Basically Active sports is more of a brute nucklehead game to play, where as video games requires a stronger mind.
As far as calling them athletes thats debatable, but I would atleast call them very professional, not only because they get paid to play in season splits, with a playoff at the end, but they carry themselves very well, and treat playing the game like a full time job, dedicating there life into playing the game w/o time for pretty much anything else.
Calling them delusional, or the fans delusional, more or less just shows how blind and narrow minded you really are.
Idk I remember buying Frosted Ezreal at 975 rp (i think) and that is basically just a recolor - now you get 3 recolors for 590 rp, I see no reason for people to be bitching.
I know Riot has improved their standard for skins, but that doesn't mean basic recolors are no longer worth money and Riot shouldn't suffer financial losses because of that increased standard.
Who does BenQ sponsor these days?
 They sponsor GMB, I think, but who else?
So first of all you completely opened my eyes, i would seriously do D or if im low i would even do E.
 I main mid and the only time i would track enemy jungler is when i want to go ham on the other mid laner.
 going on the other reactions i have seen i might be to focused on my own lane instead of objectives and things that would help my team.
In this situation would you, a mid, follow your jungler?
or would you advise your jungler what to do.
i am certain that 80% of the time the jungler in gold 5 would do the same as D or E.
Yes and Alex wasn't expecting a lucian / naut to lose to a sivir / thresh in lane.
.
 their bot and top lane both lost hard and gave up a ton of map control.
The pick was fine the rest of the team shit the bed.
 He played that pick as best as you could given what his team-mates were doing.
I think it's more people disagreeing with you than you being wrong, necessarily.
 Especially with how TSM-heavy this whole thread is.
 As unfortunate as it is, your flair probably doesn't help in this case either.
 I wouldn't worry about it.
 Downvotes happen.
 You just have to take them on the chin and carry on.
self posts don't get karma.
l2reddit.
I kinda want a green and purple one for new shack skin.
Jwaow and Dexter are both quite good too.
Errr, you do realize they got banned for using a ringer, right?
Also scrims DO matter, TSM wins scrims and then wins LCS.
 In scrims they lost to SSW and lost to SSW, CLG won in scrims and was top 2 in the entire split while they were and started to fail the same time they started losing scrims.
 Scrim results are accurate more often than not, people just ignore the times they are and harp on the times the better team in scrims lost.
And what other way would you determine who is better for the team?
 Judging based on solo queue plays?
 Really?
 Don't make yourself look stupid.
Those prices INCLUDE the skin for people who haven't bought it, pretty sure it unlocks at a cheaper price if you have the skin, just like the other bundles in the game.

He's been Plat I since the start of the season.
 And there was a point during the split where he didn't play for like 2 whole weeks.
There will still likely be a tank jungle and support even without one on top so BotRK still pays off.
they might have to nerf him, but in my opinion its not really fair to balance a champion by making them mechanically clunky
They have to reduce the cd of mark/dash.
.
 also the true damage is unnecessary.
 The initiation already made the spell OP.
I don't know why you are getting so downvoted.
 Faker, Dade and PawN are miles ahead of almost everyone (I'm still not sure exactly how good KurO or Cool are honestly)
I'd totally pay money for these, but then I do have more then one skin on over 10 champions I don't play.

It's optional, it helps fund the game, and apparently some people enjoy it.

Same, I've bought a couple dirt cheap skins when I was able to just to give back what I could, and Astronaut because he's so cool, and Naut's the only one I still play, but I'm still glad I pitched in what I could, might not be much but at least I'm trying to show my appreciation instead of trying to spread this opinion I have somehow formed in my psychotic mind that I DESERVE this for free, because I'm a loyal player of your free to play game.

Which is why I said there would be two was of donating.
 You are absolutely correct on your end.
 So I will have direct links to those charities.
 And if anyone donates toward me to get the whole twitch alerts notification I will be putting that money toward the charity as well.
 I will donate all the money on stream so everyone knows I am not a scam.
Same here.
wish em best luck
OMG were also just playing champions and compositions that they were bad at towards the end of the split.
 You are taking OMG at their word which is a mistake.
 OMG drafted seriously versus C9, C9 had superior strategy and shit on them.
 In the series, OMG only beat C9 because C9 could only practice one comp due to having a sub.
 Had Hai's lung not collapsed, C9 would have been able to play even more comps and have better late game teamfighting.
 There is no way C9 would have lost that series with Hai.
What are we trying to achieve with this straw poll.
 its going to end with one player feeling bad and feel a sense of unwelcome.
 The line up is what it is.
Dude
Lucian Prime.
?
Ive played ARAM for a long time, and i would honestly say all tanks could be dominant.
 After a period it would be op, right now varus seems really good along with the other poke mages.
 But they dont scale in ARAM IMO
Garen all the way.
Hired gun lucian?
I feel like with this build his early-mid power is almost the same but his late becomes very very strong.
 The squishies die anyway but he can also kill tanks really fast which are the biggest problem and because of the 40% cdr the enemy won't be able to get to lucian because he can almost dash 24/7
Well if that's the case, I'd take Noxiak over Nyph any day.
All people would do is pick support than go take farm or something as an ap mid laner.
 It would solve nothing unless you enforced the meta which Riot does not like to do.
If anything it might hurt team builder when it comes to the people who use it.
I've done it plenty of times in normals and it's mid game is insanely strong.
 If you position well in lane and use your shield effectively, you can even come out on top on a lot of matchups.
 His post 6 ganks are extremely strong.

 It's very solid but it's not out of this world at all.
>GBM himself said the Western player who he'd do best in Korea would be Pobelter, simply because Pobelter did by far the best in Korean solo queue out of any player who's ever gone there.
That's pretty fucking retarded of GBM 
>and you know, actually plays on a team unlike incarnation.
Why the condescending tone?
 No shit, incarnation isn't going be on a fucking team when he's banned for the last 2 years and he's not going to opt to join a challenger team after he's unbanned when he's been in talks with c9 for like 4 months now lmfao.
According to wiki hes a sub/jungler but it also says on his page that he is a coach, so it's sorta safe to assume that, I guess.
It was just an example, while obviously it might not apply to challenger you could mirror the same logic onto the other divisions like silver, gold, plat, whatever and reach the same result.
 It wasn't supposed to be taken literally.
1565 means you dont own the skin for the chroma pack.
 If you owned the skin it would only be 590.
Maybe trolling?
^^^^please
I voted for him because replacing your ADC after winning your region seems really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, stupid.

Did everyone not think Kalista was OP when she first came out?
Can you add their AD/Ap Rations?
 I've been looking for one just like this (and thanks for this btw) and also looking for ratios.
There are different traits you need to be born with to do (probably) anything at the highest level.
 Do you think anyone can be a chess grandmaster if they just play the game a lot and study?
 Of course not.
damn rito and their symbolism.
No teaser sorry, check his previous LoL videos, for example Sion reborn and at the end he says "Dick".
teaser for a new.
dick maybe ?
go outside between each game.
 You get some air, feel refreshed, and won't get queued with the same afk/trolls you were last game.
there is also the famous comeback on M5 vs CLG EU
There are people in Bronze that could run maximum APM scripts and perfect frame cancel everything, and they'd still get bodied by Silver/Gold players.
 LoL is so much less about your maximum output, and more so about doing the right thing at the right time.
I feel like zeh best buff is no way for them to cancel Q and flash Q.
 Thing is most jump ins now a days go uncontested by cc so Aatrox sits there on you or is cced to death.
 Source: I support Aatrox and hope he becomes meta.
 Also Aatrox is love Aatrox is life.
Garen is being picked all the way into Challenger commonly.
It would be cool if teams that did well and stayed in the lcs got their ward skins upgraded someway every split
I'm pretty sure this is intended, people usually enter a bush to cancel Fiora's ultimate.

What this tweet mean then?
seem a bit fishy.
They nerfed the scaling by like 5.
 That's not totally significant.
 It just sounds that way.
 At least they didn't Azir her; nerf-nuke her from fucking orbit then realize they'd actually destroyed it and decide to rebuild it way later.
that's the opposite of a problem.

No I want to hear from reputable sources I.
e.
 c9 members in official statments (anything Meteos or Sneaky say on stream is considered trolling (C9 Faker.
 Need I go on?
)) Or from one of the teams they have stomped - and even then would need to be a decent team for me to take notice.
If they beat say dig, and stomoed them, someone could say "oh hes tearing it up" and word spreads.
 I havent seen a reputable source say that he is performing well that were either a part of the scrims (players) or watched the vods (coaches and analysts) and until I do, I wont consider it anything more than what it is.
 Hearsay
Well I wouldn't be making this post if they said it would happen.
Championsuggest: na reinvii
what team is he on?
 I legit know nothing about this guy other than pro's complaining that hes toxic af.
iirc Fnatic is also pretty big in CS:GO
It's no longer one team hides under turret and slowly dies and the aram only accounts don't matter as much I love it.
Idk but they actually look pretty crappy.
It's the same with everychampion
I think what happens with Turtle currently is some people underrated him (remembering him from last season) and TSM fans overrate him (remembering him more from Season 3) when in reality is is sorta in the middle of those two sides.
 Turtle does what TSM needs him to do.
 Will he be the first person TSM looks to replace?
 Probably not because odds are Dyrus will retire (a day that will rival The General's step down in sadness) before TSM replace Turtle.
I think it's at the Plano one.
> when you've invested hundreds of hours and/or dollars into the game as well.
1.
 It is your *choice* to invest dollars.
2.
 If you need rewards for playing the game besides actually playing the game, you *really* need to rethink your perspective of League of Legends.
 really.
> It's also insane to think Chromas payable with RP AND IP wouldn't create more profit than only RP.
Why's that?
 I'd certainly go for Chromas if they were IP.
 I'm not spending RP for them.
 Many people could easily be in similar situations.
> League needs more timesinks that properly reward players
How about a League system?
 Or hours of entertainment?
 Or Champion releases?
 Or dramatic changes every year?
Are you *not* seeing what you get for free?
> Furthermore, it's straight up insulting that they are selling them in packs, which only cements this move as a good old cashgrab.
There's room for improvement, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is a cash-grab; they are a *business.
*
The difference between your attempt at a cash-grab (trying to cut prices with your perceived entitlement) and theirs is that we're all playing on Riot's field, here.
 It's *their* game.
 It's *their* choice.
And it's *your* choice if you want to support it with your wallet or not.
 If you don't, cool.
 But saying League *needs* rewarding timesinks and that expecting Riot to give you freebies on their boat is fair has **zero support whatsoever.
**
If you're offended by the Chroma batches, you need to grow a callous.
 If you're displeased, you need to gain some perspective.
 If you're expecting more than you're getting, you need to re-evaluate your worth to Riot Games.
I get a badass game and a platform that lets me enjoy theorycrafting, discussion and maintaining good contact with friends.
 For free.
 I've had it for years.
 So I paid Riot Games for what they've facilitated me getting and not only that, I've gotten a little cherry on the top for that payment that slightly boosts the quality of what they'd already given me.
Literally the *worst* thing about this whole Chroma thing is the amount of ignorance, nuance, entitlement (that word keeps coming up), belligerence and what-not from people being so predisposed to their beliefs in what they want and/or should have.
 Maybe that's just my perspective, but I could hardly be surprised if there's a substantial number of people sick and tired of mine and others' whining about each other.
Yeah and also, one of kennens main skins is a fucking red recolor, and nor you're realising bundles of recolors.
 Do you something wrong here or is that just me?
 Hotshot is the problem.
 When a team is consistently bad over many years the problem is at the top.
Yep; had it too.
Nothing's happening to Shyv as far as we know.
 Literally 0 proposed changes.
Hawaii is like.

you know what.
Well Fenix is supposed to be THE scrim god and hes Korean.
 Just depends on the player,
Fuck that was way too short
nah seriously it was nice, maybe a little bit too much angle on the last part but seriously I'm just asking for more
Would go nice with a Pokemon train Kalista skin.
 Kalista Ult's and throws out Kennenchu
recently, in the middle of a losing streak, I had a dced malzahar top at the beginning of the game (10 minutes more or less).
 I was ez, but somebody decided to pick caitlyn too in champ select.
I went with ezreal top agaist irelia.
 Ended the game 11/1/?
 , still the game was lost without hope.
I just wanted you to know that you are not alone out there.
Skill isn't something that really belongs in LoL conversations in my opinion.
 There are champions who are comparatively incredibly difficult (Yasuo) and there are champions who are incredibly easy (Yorick, Ryze).
 The ease of play is more about how *individual players* prefer to play, and not about translating to in game gains necessarily.
 Harder =/= stronger and easier =/= weaker.
However, consistency v.
s.
 potential are mapable and fair.
 Someone might argue that easy champions are consistent while hard ones could be the potential, however in the hands of an expert even a difficult champion can become consistent, whereas with random % chance you cannot have that happen.
hotshot best leblanc in the world faker said it himself
This point is so heavily exaggerated.
 Take a look at where a lot of these pros were when they got picked up.
 Like half of them aren't from the west coast.
 Some examples, Quas was playing in Venezuela and still got Challenger.
 There are players in Japan at Masters.
 A good player will get to high elo even if they have high ping.
Dude?
 Why stop there?
 Why not just create a complete Pikachu skin

Greenland is Denmark.

Techincally.
 It would be weird to call them danish tho.
With flame on the table amazingj will have trouble, but that guy is really good and I think m3 or king could really do well with him
I'm not stating that Yusui *is* better for the team.
 I'm saying we don't know and it's impossible to know.
 Both sides of the circlejerk are really stupid.
 People thought after C9t's game against misfits last night that Yusui's performance (nothing spectacular, no fuck ups.
 It's ziggs ffs) that warranted him a spot on C9 and that he would automatically become a top 5 mid in NA.
And although it may seem like Incarnati0n is automatically better skill wise than Yusui, there's no legitimate evidence you could point toward that would give a substantial argument to prove this.
 Arguably, one could reference all of the pros who have said that Incarnati0n has already passed his peak and the Yusui camp could say he has yet to touch his.
This sub-reddit really needs to stop pretending they know who the better replacement is.
 Shit, even C9 scrimming with the players only gives them a slightly better idea than reddit because teams can evolve much differently than when they initially started.
Your last point is a bit vulgar, but there's some truth to it.
 It's /r/LoL so of course people are going to overvalue people's personality's and incorrectly determine their actual skill level based off their affection for said players.
 However, the same can happen with players who are perceived to be good.
 Look at DL.
 He got so much hype for some flashy plays and for a long time people thought he was a better adc than Sneaky, when we know that's definitely not the case if you're discussing all facets of play.
What happens when you restart the client?
First of all - E-sports is a grey zone in terms of law, IRL even criminals get out of jail eventually, I'm gonna use Last Shadow's arguement on XJ9 saying that what he did would give him 2 Years at most if he got put in jail.
I have most champs, and it's the worst change to happen to lol in a long time.
You mean more people will pick support as an option but take another role for easy IP?
 That's very flawed
There is already an anime.

What?
 You don't want to watch good players win worlds?
And he did great on CLG, despite their problems.
 Could potentially be top 3 jungle in EU.
i just have 1 question.
 who the hell even watches this guy?
 lmao
Nice try UberDanger
> Regardless I don't think Monte or Thoorin really give any fucks about challenger or any competition of that level 
I perfectly understand that.
 And I don't think they have to watch something at all if it's of no interest.
 But then they shouldn't bother talking about it.
Thorin, rightly, calling out Hotshot for saying how "Solo Q has no talent" and that bullshit.
 Yet Thorin and Monte talking about Challenger having no talent when neither even watch it.
It's bullshit and hypocrisy and it actually hurts the scene as well.
He was suggesting (very clearly) that he wants it to be free; as if he and every one else as players deserve it.
 There's no way to argue that that is the case any more than there is an argument to sell them.
Plus, his demeanour to the whole idea was crass.
 I'm not against 'voting with your wallet'.
 I'm against his perspective overall on Chromas.

 Bjergsen gets usually the majority of say though.
Dunkey you earned my sub on Youtube.
 Funny content man, keep it up!
Once again, that's because there has never been a 2x IP incentive before.
I've always liked Lucian, but I didn't like either of his skins, so I'm definitely gonna buy his chromas.
 I don't like any of the other chromas enough to justify buying them though.
inb4 league becomes maplestory (purchasable expirable content, ashe q rework)
the direction the enemy gets pushed also changes
I don't think the downgrade to U from PawN is what makes or breaks the team but rather team synergy and strategy.
 They've played with PawN all season and the sudden switch to U without much practice obviously would bring down the level of EDG, especially considering the importance of midlane.

No but the fact that he's from EU means hes obviously going to be a good midlaner.
 C9 will base their decision on this scientific fact.

He's just getting held back, gg
From my understanding people preferred the DLift that trashtalked and was so overconfident that he threw games.
Now he plays pretty averagely on game day, no longer talks shit and frequently says things just to sound smart.
 The whole auto-spacing fiasco is a symptom of that.

Both sides can be right, and it's rather silly of you to not realize it:
>.
support player Lewis "Noxiak" Felix.
 Felix has reportedly declined offers to the teams the like of Elements.
>Guys i didnt declined a spot at the EL starting rooster just to make clear
Those two statements don't contradict at all.
 Elements offered Noxiak a position within the organization and he declined it.
 Noxiak clarified that the position was not as a starter.
 Wolf is right; Noxiak is right.
 There's no "misstrust" by the community.
 You just failed to comprehend things.
riven is not strong in the tank meta 
she gets rekt by cc and is also easily countered by armor (dont really know why but she has huge problems with high armor enemies not like other ad casters)
and this is basically what every team has
riven is the same as master yi kata etc.
 if the enemy knows how to teamfight properly vs those they are gonna be useless
Warden is beautiful though.
Only the little ghost images behind him apply the fear?
 TIL
i've played against two people who've done this.
 If you mid laner doesn't have an escape or is extremely bad with other jumping on them, they will have a really hard time after 6.
 Also his roam potential is devastating if he gets a little bit ahead.
 But if you can burn his flash and get your laner to burn his shield ganking is super easy.
I enjoyed it.
 Very fun edit man.
 Keep up the good work!
Only fix I've found for it is to repair the client.
Had to do it twice now
Right?
 And Karthus' Q deals (potentially) the most damage of any spell in the game.

v=yJDAgMVzNto)
Monte isn't a Korean fanboy.
 He likes good League of Legends.
 And Korea is where you find it.
Also he himself rated EDG as the best team in the world recently.
While true, you underestimate the laziness of people (or some just don't have time).
 If it costs IP, that means you'll need to grind out IP for chroma skins instead of just shelling out $$ for RP.
 Lazy people that don't want to grind as long will buy RP to purchase IP boosts so they can get their goal quicker and buy a chroma or simply buy a boost to farm as much IP as they can so they can get multiple chromas.
Also people valuing chromas more than champions, they'll spend their IP on the skins and then be more likely to purchase champions with RP or also buy IP boosts.
I guess nobody should ever try it again ever just because it didn't work for one team.
So.
 Let's take a look.
Top: A player that hasn't played competitively for over 1.
5 years.
Jungle: A slightly above average NA LCS jungler.
 Had his best split 2 years ago in EU with the at the time best offensiv mid-laner in the LCS as well as sidelanes that never lost lane by themselfs.
Mid: A SoloQ God that has never played on stage and has an unclear character/team-spirit.
ADC: You misspelled Forg1ven.
Support: A player that wasn't even Top 2 at any time of bis career.
 Also washed up.
If that is the EU Superteam EU is fucked and should be switched out for Japan at Worlds.
his team never end well
Ah, thanks, my bad.
If that is the new roster, froggens hopes of getting far in worlds are ruined once again.
 why don't they poach forgiven, import a korean support (so eu has 1 actual world class support) and get a jungler that hasn't been clg'd :(
I am not sure which AD SK could get to get to these 4 teams.
 Except they get some korean or chinese import.
his skin evolves with every ultimate upgrade, That's a neat one, + his taunt and dance are cool ;) AND the sound on his Q is nice.
H2K was made up of a bunch of people from prior LCS teams and C9-Eclipse and I can't even think of anything in NA that would really compare.
 You can't take chances between Spring and Summer split with worlds on the line it's just stupid lol.
 Will CLG get first I doubt it.
 Will any team not named TSM get first?
 Also doubtful.
 There's just no moves that will get them anywhere meaningful so why bother.
 If the teammates want to stay together then let them.
Good goy.
Sneaky?
I think he was adding on to your comment about the fact that just because someone is a god in solo queue doesn't mean it translates all that well to team play.
 Just because Hotshot is very good at leblanc doesn't mean he's the best choice for a team.
> since you build BotRK on him.
as long as you're not up vs a tank on top, woulnd't do that at all anymore
A lot of them might be foreign exchange students in America from China.
They're often playing on the University net and are shit as a result.

Lets say you have all three sheen items, you will only get the spellblade damage from whichever single one does the most, for example if you have all three but have three other ap items it'll probably be lich bane, but i think you get icebourne slow aswell regardless.
 But basically never ever do it.
I just wish the situation wasn't so binary.
 It's not that I don't like chromas, it's that I don't like the price and the method of acquisition.
 But not buying the chromas will not tell you any of that, it will just tell you that I don't want the chromas.
You can place Soraka E underneath you and laugh.
Better yet, make it Mordekaiser.
 and only available to China.

iirc, most players rush a runaan's hurricane first, and then BT because the lifesteal procs off the hurricane bolts as well
They didn't learn from their first temporary ward attempt?
well, how do we know gilius actually knows it and tells the truth ?
maybe hes just naming the rumors and thats what the rumors say.
I believe it's "first game" not the entire split but if that's inaccurate I'd appreciate a link
I run Trinity Force quints.
Yeah that has always what has stopped me from playing Ryze.
 He always seemed fun but the stutter stepping killed all sense of fluidity for me.

Weirdly enough, first answer says he gave him a run for his money, and the second one says he basically didn't do shit vs Bjergsen because 1 he lost, and 2 he got ganked.
Thanks!
 I hadn't caught that.
 Reading through it, it looks like it's pretty much the same consensus as this thread.
Just because they won as a team doesn't mean there aren't better individual players on the other team that could work better in your lineup than the people you have.
If Faker was on coast and they almost every game because not even Faker can 1v5 enough with that supporting roster, it wouldn't mean you don't want Faker because you beat them.
Obviously it's a very exaggerated example, but it's possible either Altec or Pobelter are decent upgrades while the teamplay or other factors (Poor morale/communication/tensions) among pob's team caused them to be beaten.
Or more likely, they need better players in the actual LCS because they no longer have Alex "EloBoost" Ich.
Don't worry, her Q will be a skill shot before long and her R will have travel time
Nah make all the champions available that you have in your collective pool.
So if I group with 9 aram accounts they have access to all of my champions and theirs.
This way if people make an aram account and face off vs 9 other aram accounts then it's just op champs vs op champs.
This is a terrible thread, move aside, move aside.
I mean did you try asking riot to transfer the points?
eggniva*
Or he could have looked at what seemed more likely.
 That Alliance that just won the Split and looked great would work well or that a fnatic that pretty much gets build from scratch perform well?
 I mean the circlejerking on rekkles may be funny, but it just looks like a fairly logical decision to depart from fnatic.
It looks awkward now, but I at least can see why you would take those decisions on every instance
If there is a pricing flaw, then there is a pricing flaw, it doesn't have to mean anyone is getting screwed over and just like everyone says, most people like 1 or 2, meaning you could get the 2 you like for cheaper than the current pack.
been playing nocturne for a while, mostly as a counterpick though.
 such as veigar or ziggs or orianna or xerath.
Think about it this way.
 You get another weekend of super high calibre games instead of a weekend with no pro games.
Gave me legit recurring nightmares, I loved Courage and all but I noped out of that episode every time.
championsuggest: eune Margrabia Eithne
Well, there goes my soloQ Nocturne, thanks.
Fair enough.
 It's the game crashingness that reminded me.
>We Kind of Cared when it happened to Rhux and Gleeb 
When did it happen to them?
 Rhux and Gleeb never played for a team that promoted through the challenger series.
This hasn't really been a problem.
 Last split the three new NA teams were Gravity, Team 8, and Coast.
 Only Coast made any roster changes and not until week 5.
 Previous splits were LMQ (no changes until after the split), Complexity (only made a change because of Visa problems), Velocity (first change was in week 5) and Cloud9 (no changes until now.
)
Ironically the Unicorns of Love are the only team I can think of that made a big change before the season (Gillius was the one that helped them qualify and was replaced by Kikis before the split.
) H2K was forced to make a change when Febiven left the team.
 Giants made no changes.
 I don't know enough about previous EU challenger teams to know if teams made changes.
Basically this is the first time it's ever happened in NA.
 TDK is forced to do it in midlane since Kyle is retiring from competitive and Alexich doesn't seem to want to play with them.
 But they also seem to want to replace Louis so it'd still be a first time.
 I can't see NME making any changes.
I just noticed that you crited me in that Lucian 1v1 WHAT THE HELL
exp boosts already do that 
Wait what the fuck?
 What was the point in releasing a poll to hear our opinions if they are just going to ignore us anyway?
 I thought it was a way better idea to properly incentivize champion mastery system.
 Instead they're like "Na fuck that will give them a shitty emote, this way we can make money off these overpriced recolours"
Unluckiest team was fnatic bro
I think it'd be cool if they decided together.
 T0M and Bengi could choose too.
So Xpecial said he wouldn't want to pick Alex Ich up, but he wouldn't even want to give Alex a try out either?
Is this one of azir death soldiers?
 Cuz that's what I getting from the splash art?
he probably didn't want a bunch of idiotic fanboys spamming his ask.
fm, asking if the rumors were true.
 I would probably do the same exact thing in his position
You're kidding right?
Absolutely agree.
 Although I have my issues with the icons too.
 I mean I buy it every year because yeah, I do want to support my team.
 But whenever it's "CAPS ON, FLAIRS UP" season, I always just go with my Season 3 icon because the icon is bigger and the lack of year makes it less distracting.
 Honestly probably their biggest mistake there was ever making an icon that DIDN'T have the year on it.
Nice job downvoting for "off-topic" or "doesn't contribute to discussion.
"
You're the worst kind of person.
1: It is hard to see the snowball.
 Thus it is really fucking hard to dodge.
2: If you're up against one of the champions I mentioned, you need an escape and a good disengage to get away from them, or you need enough damage to outright kill them.
 As Varus, for example, they just stacked armor that completely outshined my armor pen, and sat on me until I died.
 It was completely impossible to get away from them without a summoner+my ult, and I would usually die in the duration of their ccs, packing mr and bt.
If you're on a full ap comp with no disengage or sustained damage, the tanks can just go locket-visage-banshees-orb and just sit on you.
Also,
3: If you don't get a comp that has a frontliner, then who tanks the snowball?
 If that person happens to be part of your back line, you can get completely rolled over by a champion like Morgana or Amumu.
Well.
 I have been following pobelter for ages hoping that he will make it big.
 Back before the season began I remember anxiously waiting to here about the new EG roster with all the speculation over limit/ignar.
 I was hoping that the team would be aggressive with multiple carry options from the mid and toplane with altec as a consistent adc.
I really think the meta really didn't help WFX with the shift from assassins in the mid to supportive mids and the juggermaw comp pobelter was unable to hard carry/delete people.
 Additionally the lack of bot lane synergy with the indicision on the supports really hurt the team.
Avalon was lackluster, and we really only saw a couple games from Imagine (after waiting like 1/3 the split for him).
Overall, I was disappointed with how the season ended up.
TiP actually is my team to watch now.
 I like the agression and many things I had looked forward to Winterfox having.
 Also, I like Apollo's ego, reminds me of oldschool doublelift.
 Adrian is the cinderella story of going pro.
 XWX is adorable and although he has been lackluster, he looked to be improving to the end of the split.
 Rush's aggression is great to watch.
 And Impact is a monster.
Tell me when you get out of bronze and realize ADC picks matter the least.
Big hit to his tankiness was the passive on his ult giving 10/20/30% cdr instead of it being on his Q or w/e it was before.
 Now he cant build a 20% cdr item (like Frozen Heart, core to his old build) or even Athene's/Morrello's now without going 10% over the cdr cap at lvl 3 ulty.
 Havent played him at all yet but thats definitely the first thing that popped out at me.
 I do like that he can build more ap items though.
 A lich bane on him could be fun.
If your goal is *winning high-pressure games to prove you are the best team,* I would posit that perhaps players who crack under pressure will not help a team achieve that goal.
Diamond 5 is bad right now cause of the "I'm Diamond I'm good now" ego boost that plat players get when they reach the tier.
 Unfortunately, they don't realize that Diamond 5 was 100-200 elo above what it is now, back in season 4 (due to master tier being added).
Sad times but it should also be easy for players of higher skill to get out of that elo.
He pretty much deleted all his tweets and his ask few days ago no idea why though maybe it had to something with the rumours.
I belive the crit system in LoL wouldn't allow for this since it stacks up?
 Like if you have 20% and don't on the first attack it goes up to 40% then 60% then 80% then 100%.
 I think this is correct or maybe I just read something wrong 1 year ago and have yet to be proven wrong which would make me feel rather silly
"Krepo is retiring, *again*, I think.
"
Subtle shots fired?
 Aha I love xpecial
I don't hope for the best FPS.
 A 40 WILL DO FOR ME.

ANY ONE?

Disable the main form of communication?
 Tribunal doesnt even exist currently, so i don't see how it would help riot deal with the cases when its completely automated.
In fact im going to stop there, NONE of your ideas make ANY SENSE at all.
Probably a hard decision for HyperX
yo.
Won't be Ao Shin, some Rioter said he probably wouldn't be released this year.
 However there have been rumors that a new lightning themed champ may be released.
EDIT: Just realized I basically said exactly what another person said in the comments.
The thing is though, LoL is at the peak of its popularity.
 If you're good enough, you can make some serious bank now.
 Wait three more years, and it's not certain that's still the case.
 While games often survive with a niche audience for many years, a real peak in mainstream popularity is often short-lived.
 Sooner or later, the concept/genre of the game grows stale, the game becomes outdated, another game captures the attention of the mainstream audience,.
.
 For WoW, that peak lay at 12 million subscribers five years ago.
 It's been slowly decaying since (with occasional surges when a new xpac is released).
 That's bound to happen to LoL as well soon, and when the game suffers, I think so will the esports side of it.
What playing fire emblem feels like.
do you like pie?
Do u wanna beat asians or diabetus
I think it's the other way around.
 People with high elo spend time in this sub.
 Its like entering a hospital and asking why there are so many doctors around.
Some people like simplistic skins doe
Guys it's not about support annie its about mid annie.
 She gets to play so agressive while also playing so safe.
 The range nerf was really needed imo
Exciting times.
 I'm still sad about Hai but I'm excited for the future.
Honestly i see them being 10th place.
 Maybe if they pick up a good mid and altec they could be higher.
truly the funnest.
I think TSM actually have significantly better drafts than SKT does currently.
Ping is usually a result of internet speed x proximity to server.
 The best way to lower your ping is to get better internet!
 Of course that can be difficult.
 Try making sure the game is on your firewalls exempt list or maybe using an ethernet cord.
 Hope that helps.

Which was forever ago.
Also Trundle was only viable because he countered the other three.
Yeah he was talking to me bro.
 It's common decency to TL;DR any post where you wrote an unreasonably long rant, I've just been up for like 4 days and forgot.
 But he reminded me so I complied.
 Like what if an old lady is crossing the street all slow and painful looking do you just skip by her?
 No reason to be rude, hell I was probably a jack ass in that rant, but I at least acknowledged it.
nope

where do you people see Yusui as some amazing player?

Instead of giving her ult some mana cost, what about adding 1 sec delay to her W/R second cast?
 Tbh, I'm okay with her dmg as long as they punish her mobility.
Of course, but that half obviously doesn't exist at the moment, so here's the other.
Also just hope other redditors are in your game and downloaded it as well.
so you mean like you get for winning worlds.
pretty sure you need to win worlds to get your own skins.
stop fan boying so hard?
But that late game, that much gold increase won't really matter because what are you gonna use the gold on?
the difference between me and m'lady is larger than the difference between the top of my fedora and the bottom after i tip it, gg
Yes
How bad must EU be if he wants to be in trash land?
 :)
Yay, more stats so people can bash Dyrus.
 He does exactly what he needs to do to ensure TSM wins.

I guess his ult might be bugged because he definitely went right through Yorick.
And they'll probably make much more money off of this Ezreal skin than they would have off of Yorick.
Yeah!
 Take it back!
 You can't dupe easily in Gold!
Tibbers = Uberdanger ?
They dont go to jail they just get detained.
Ask MashMe
That build looks far too oriented towards killing enemy carries.
 Tbh it looks pretty bad you'd do almost no DPS on tanks and depending on your other teammates that might fuck your team over really hard
Idk keep experimenting and let me know how it goes against certain comps
LOL
ok, how.
COME ON GUYS, READ THEIR FUCKING NAME XD
It's only in turkey now.
 They said that in the announcement.
 Gotta read
I mean, the problem isn't even that he is too passive, it's just that *everyone* on ALL is too passive.
 Steeelback plays almost the exact same role on Fnatic that Rekkles did.
 They run aggressive top, aggressive roaming mid, aggressive jungle and scaling bottom lane.
 It's what they did with the previous line-ups and what they have done with the S4 line-up.
 That's simply their style, and Rekkles is proven effective in that style.
 He will be fine playing clean-up on a team where Huni and ReignOver are going fucking HAM 24/7 with Febiven evaporating people from the mid-line, he just can't do anything with his style on a team where top is farm, mid is farm, bot is farm and the jungle is desperately trying to do something productive with all 3 lanes in Facebook-game mode.
 ALL is 5 very talented players who are determined that the Cookie Clicker meta must survive in LoL.
A FRAUUUUUDDDDDDDDD
If it's so difficult to just do a recolor then why do we have special weapon zac?
 its BASICALLY a chroma with a few squiggles added to the blobs.
 I guess I'm just salty one of my favorite champions is literally never getting a skin.
 I thought maybe since he's seeing some play again he'd get some love with the chromas.
 Guess not.
Tanks are big, Assassins are put in their place, and ADCs need to shred armor.
its obviusly that champ was based wit lava or something like that thats why dunkeys video is named Escape from Hell.
 Hell have lava.
.
well thats my theory
I dunno about Bard, but this was the Vel'koz teaser: https://www.

v=KEQO_RbRYOE
He might win something then 
League does not deserve for rekt
Nope.
 They're working on making something so NA can play on one server but have more stable ping 
Never was like this before.
 Other champs work with hydra, Garen when he spins, fiora while she ults.
In contrast, you should do the opposite, do better so that Fnatic would have no choice but to keep you.
I have to say Fnatic is great with the current line up.
 Any change would lower their morale and cause the team to do bad
tsm is probably worth a couple million at this point so it's safe to assume he's making at least 200k+
It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile winning is winning.
The thing with custom chromas is that only you can see them afaik.
I wouldn't buy any skin if only I could see the changes.
Step 1) Random Fiddlesticks
Step 2) Throw out mark
Step 3) See if Mark hits an enemy
Step 4) If it did, start ulting
Step 5) When you finish channeling your ult you still have enough time to dash to your target and maybe flash even deeper
Step 6) Pentakill

Boxing themed Vi skin sounds pretty good.
I did not see Scrims.
 I have been watching Inc and Yusui soloQ streams, and judging this based on there personalities and reactions towards things in the game.
 Yusui is very cocky, young, he's basically a punk w/o going to deep into it, theres better ways to say it but fck it.
'
Inc has more experience in team play (he was SK's coach) he's learned to control hsi emotions (ban), and he's very good in terms of mechanics.
 He seems like he would be a clear choice, but you never know, he may be a total douche when it comes to team play, And I bet that if he is, Yusui is garuntee'd to be a total kiss ass for atleast the first 3 months untill his ego blows lol.
Rengar has to work by right clickimg near the enemy, then on the enemy, then while mid air press E for instant root, hit keys whole generating ferocity, Empower E again and you have a sucessful gank.
 thats without chaining CC too.
 Only way to counter that gank is Mikaels (which you dont have early) or summoner spells.
 Which just leaves them open again in 2 mins time.
While it is point and click, the u riable CC makes his more reliable gap closer less reliable for actually getting anything in return overall.
 Not to mention rengar scales into fights better (again CC, sustain, better pick, ult grants vision, more damage and the list goes on)
Noc needs a touch up, and his ult is a good place to start
I've heard pro players on stream say they thought (or heard) he was overhyped.
 I think even Rekkles, who's friends with him, said he's not as good as he once was.
 But considering how good mids in EU are, I'm sure he's still just as good as most of the EU LCS mid laners at the very least.
I have found in practice games that maxing his E does seem to make him someone to be feared.
 While people can stay out of his range i think him might make a good champ for double comps where he can lower the mr of the team for someone else to get the final blow.
Nothing in New York, really?
 :[
Probably wouldn't have been able to get in anyway with how crazy the amount of players there are here, I guess.
Yet another team considers importing a midlaner in a league where almost all midlaners are imported, that says something about the state of na's domestic midlane talent 
Yeah, it is kind of lame that we need to pay for recolors, such a 2010 thing to do.
 Also, making them achievable by having a great time playing your favourite character a lot makes it so much more valuable, and it makes the player feel special because the skin is a symbol of his commitment/dedication/great results.
Even Mortal kombat (they went full DLC sellout with mkx, awesome game though) offers free recolors, so at least you can look different than the opposing identical character.
^ps: ^If ^you ^guys ^make ^recolors ^for ^blood ^lord ^Vladimir ^i ^will ^love ^you ^forever, ^RP ^or ^not (^yes, ^particles ^included, ^or ^it ^will ^look ^half-assed.
) ^:^)
almost double?
 You mean about 15% more?
 i mean.
.
 thats not really anywhere near double.
That would be stupid.
 They should just pay us to take the skins.
I feel like you guys are the Grasshyren of the modern era.
That's a compliment.
Have you read Blitz' W description lately?
Rekkles is a last hitting machine.
 Minions and champions.
Honestly, i hate pick and call order.
 Id rather have my teammates talk it out as opposed to someone getting shafted because they are last pick.
This also helps to promote not being cunts to each other.
Just looking at his match history he isn't playing his main role, probably playing to improve his champion diversity and familiarity, not his rank.

Wall of text:
My post isnt about the pricing.
 I dont think it is worth the rp (as said in the post).
 My post is against the idea of making them "free".
If you are at a store its completly fine to reason with the owner to lower the price of something overpriced.
 However it is acctually pretty antisocial to go there and demand to get something for free.
Well lets not say free.
 Lets say you demand it for using a service you acctually like, that they are providing for free.
But thats still not the point of my post.
The point is, that its completly counterproductive for a company to hand out something for free that is almost similar to their main product.
Ofc there are companys that are doing that.
 Their income is usually donations or advertisement.
I for example use open office.
 There was a time, when there was no free office software and you basically had to buy one.
 Well the free one isnt as good as the one you can buy but it is enough for me and my demands.
Im quite sure, that with the introduction of free office software, the sales for office software decreased.
Lets say Riot would hand out the Chroma Packs as an Achivement now.
 Imho the sales for skins will decrease.
 There are people who will still buy skins but there are also people who will just go for chroma packs because they are enough for their demands.
 At that point the guy who came up with the idea of chroma packs, the idea to give the customer a choice and a new service, is the asshole.
 At that point he made the company lose money.
 And that is counterproductive to the basic idea of profit.
So Riot has 2 choices now.
Sell their product or dont release it.
 Every other move is counterproductive from the companys point of view.
 And even that is not a bad thing.
 If the company wants profit, they have to provide something we acctually want.
tl;dr
The point is, that its completly counterproductive for a company to hand out something for free that is almost similar to their main product.

are you really asking for money here?

Gotta be honest.
 Misleading title.

What kind of person writes jokes this bad?
I think being charmed by ahri would be a debuff since the new champion would be a male ( ?º ?? ?º) 
I don't even, what.

*facepalm*
let me put it this way.
 With your whole team, you may be able to outplay a tank if they provide peel or not, but individually, it's extremely difficult to outplay a tank, simply because if you sit there and auto them you'll die before they will, because they usually take thornmail.
Yes I did watch that game 4 between skt and cj.
 It would be important to note that his team was built around supporting their adc.
 He always had shields on him, and the team decided that they would make him carry.
Rookie is very debatable lol.
You called?
i've seen top players buying black cleaver on him since the patch, so i've been getting that as my damage item then armor or mr
You seem to think that Riot being a business makes it so we have no right to bitch about them wanting more money.

No no no no.
 You got it wrong here bro.
 C9/TSM were the shit team who magically made it through just to get crushed.
Fnatic would have had a real chance to go at least to the semi.
 And yes top 4 is already great.
Didn't happen, can't prove it, but you just have to check world matches and open your eyes, you'll the level Fnatic displayed.
 (Although, yes, they got really surprised by LMQ Yasuo in their first match at worlds.
)
Since when is it bad to hype up a team from a big playerbase region?
 Also everything can happen Team WE defeated GE tigers at iem and got second place as the underdog, you can't just predict it.
Now stop being negative, all teams have a chance to win.

How is that a fiasco?
 Just proofs that the League community is pretty immature.

Teemo's clear is terrible so you won't be farming to stack the devourer so no you would get the AP one
Not saying its perfect trust me, thats just how its coded to work.
 It could have picked up all of you guys as afk but its an automated system to try and pick these things up easier for riot without the tribunal up.
>I disagree on the previous game experience though.
 The best players in the world are very young and have never played other games competitively.
This is, like, blatantly wrong.
 If you look up any given pro player, they've been gaming at least semi-seriously since they were at least 8-9, and many had older siblings who were gamers at even younger ages (and younger siblings learn *anything* their older siblings do comparatively faster, if they do it together, gaming being a good example of that).
Fizz Q being Flashable is another one and I'm certain there are more I just can't be arsed to dig
Yeah I think I saw one post about how chromas should be free in this one and I was just like fuck not this again, this was the first good thread I'd seen about chromas like ever, and I was off to the races before I knew it.

I have to stay with Edward on this one.
 He has been with the team longer and I am gonna stay faithful to him and support him.
if we get to see it tomorrow vs GE, that would be interesting to say the least
Yeah this nerf made E pretty much useless unless you max it.
Even on mid morg I had my shields being broken by a single blitzcrank hook.
 Base shield is 70 and I had an additional 155 from AP, but blitzhook base damage is more than that.
I would prefer it.
 C9 needs someone besides inc.
And how do these things apply to cosmetics?
"I shouldn't pay money to look cool because I took the time to play the game.
" 
THAT is terrible terrible logic.
I don't think it ruins the game, but I do think it needs a bit of a longer CD.
 I'd put it at around 30-40 seconds and maybe shorten the distance a tad.
during breaks
This almost exactly happened to me but I was playing katarina.
 I walked through an ez ult with like 50 health.
 It was sometime this past week.
Heavy grinding in early gen 2?
 Hmmm, not so sure.
 I remember sweeping everything til Clair with only Togekiss and Ampharos, and you get those 2 pretty early on the history.
About favorites, mine is probably between Crystal and ORAS.
 I like DPPt quite a bit as well but oh god I hate so much the region that I'd prefer to stick needles thru my eyes rather than play platinum again.
 Several of my favorites (like Infernape and Togekiss) came out during that generation tho.
I live in Los Angeles for college but come home to Dallas for summer so i didnt get to go to the Legacy Cinemark for worlds, i was wondering if you could tell me, is it worth?
 Like what do you do, is it just like *buy food, go in, sit down, watch league* just like a normal movie?
 I was just curious as to how a viewing party works in a movie theater.
I don't imagine this means much.
 Dunkey is known to add lots of little tidbits to the end of his videos.
 However, if this becomes a trend in League YouTube videos in general (see Vel'Koz), then this certainly means something!
I agree with your changes to "nerf" Mark/Dash which are: 
* 1 min cooldown 
* shorter activating window (I would also add: **no reduced cooldown** when dash is used) 
* shorter range (right now it is just absurd) 
But I would also probably change two more things: 
* can only hit champions 
* does not deal damage (maybe it is just because right now the short CD and long range make the free true damage poke appear ridiculous so it could be kept if other nerfs are considered) 
Then it would be a good engage tool for struggling melee champions or champions without real gap closer / way to get into the fight, without being an overpowered spell that makes all the tanks and bruisers impossible to deal with.
 And it would add counterplay, by staying behind the creeps for instance, instance of being affraid to be even near your own minions at any time.
I loved playing tanks/bruisers in ARAM because I knew that even against a poke-heavy team you had a chance in mid-game team fights.
 It required to pass through the difficult early game, but it was possible to do something later on.
 Now if the good early of the immobile squishy carries disappear, ARAM simply becomes "League of Bruisers" which is pretty annoying.
Anyone who buys a chroma pack no matter how wealthy they may be, that person is a retard.
Just because you didn't wish someone cancer or something like that doesn't mean you weren't toxic .
You don't get those bans without a reason!
You say faker is a liar?

 If they were good enough to compete in the lcs then they'd already be there.
>They should not be a reward.
 Everything that is cosmetic should be paid for.
 Why you ask?
 Because thats how free to play games should work.
 Making them achivable is that minus-one-million-dollar idea noone likes to have.
not sure if that could be farther from the truth.
 if you have ways for users to spend money, some forms of grindable unlockables will keep them on the platform, and thus, spending more money.
Doublelift being "bad at theorycrafting" or "always being wrong" are two reddit circlejerks that never had any basis.
 He correctly predicted what would happen with the adc item changes.
Trinity Kog was bad for a lot of reasons.
 Picking Kog was bad in itself because he sucked in the meta at the time and would've only been picked as a late game hyper carry with a team comp built around him, Trinity wasn't then and isn't currently an item you want on Kog in the late game at 6 items.
 Kog also had higher mana costs so playing him as a caster where you mindlessly spam spells to proc spellblade wasn't a good idea at the time because his W had a mana cost and he couldn't afford to run out of mana towards the end of a fight lest he becomes a 500 range ADC with no mobility.
 Also his Q was targetable and wasn't always able to be used to proc spellblade.
The video was just having a bit of fun, if you actually think Doublelift and everyone else at the desk there was wrong you're an idiot.
I always imagined Talon's blades on his W were attached to little strings he throws out and pulls back, and that it didnt return because he was dead and couldn't pull them back.
 Just my little explanation I made up on why it is that way.
He may be caustic, but he has a point.
and people downvoted me for saying that he knows as much as we do :\^)

When leveling and alternate account to 30, I made some really good friends with 2 Japanese and 1 Chinese player.
 They didn't troll and we ended up inviting each other to more games (Didn't find all 3 in the same game).
I've played with a bunch of English speaking who troll and feed when they don't get their way.
 More trolls and feeders that spoke perfect English than foreigners, that's for sure.

 This is different.
 Manager's move on often in a lot of teams.
 It would be the same situation as Rekkles if a player for example Azpilicueta leaves for a "better" team, then next year when their team faces relegation and Chelsea is on top, he asks to move back to them.
Hey, Meteos carried a game a few days ago as Miss Fortune jungle.
can't let the champions on your team hold you back.
With a small sample size and a biased response group.
 If you take Stats 101 the first thing you learn is to decide how a certain type of poll may present non-representative answers.
 For example, if you do a landline survey, you're not going to get many young respondents.
 Same for physical mail.
If you give out a survey, the people that answer are likely ones that are more involved in the game and scene.
 It's not unreasonable to assume that a large portion of people don't care to answer polls, especially for things that may never become part of the game, but they also care enough about things once they become reality.
He may not be the most overbearing tank but he's funny as fuck to play (who doesn't love to spin-to-win while doing a handstand)

 I'm actually kind of interested, is his father disappointed because of his involvement in eSports?
 And I guess I'll change my statement to a hypothetical, I feel like there could be potential to be a gateway for bigger contracts.
It's also the only summoner spell that can miss (and will regularly do so).
 Mark has a low cooldown, but I'll happily bet that you don't end up using the Dash half of the spell that much more often than other summoners (expect perhaps Flash).
 Between the shots you miss and the shots that would end up getting you killed, there aren't that many good opportunities to follow up on casting a Mark.
 Maybe you could argue that the cooldown should be 25s or 30s instead of 20s but I really doubt that a few seconds makes the difference between balanced and "incredibly oppressive.
" 
do you really give a fuck about someone saying "LOL"
like holy fuck league of legends is a video game it's not that serious man, all he did was say LOL anyway
Looks like bards really cracking down on helping us find the bugs.
When playing on my higher elo account I often will.
 I main ADC and jungle, but I am a very good support as well.
 If ADC and Jungle are called, I will often go support because I know I can provide a great deal of value to the team from that position.
However, if I'm on one of my lower elo accounts I'm going to carry if at all possible.
 But yeah, pick order is given the precedence.

I've just been in gold 2-3 for about 60 games now.
 i don't see where i can improve, there's always one basic issue that i forget which snowballs me out of the game.
 Either watching a ward, buying a ward, or just watching my other lanes lose, making 0 progress.
No ideia, no Rioter has shown up to clarify anything after posting that
I'm not sure if you heard Thoorin talk then(he talks alot and deviates soo.
).
 Not specifically about Dignitas, but how he often times has power rankings, and actual team ranking.
 Listening to his spiel, even if he did care about relegation matches, he would maybe give you the benefit and say Kiwi had a huge power rating after his relegation performances, but him and his overall team historically are quite in the gutter still.
What would matter to Thoorin is if his short term power ranking boost continued into the next split, and helped his team improve their standings.
 Until then it's all about "what if's" or special matches that don't even account for at least 1/2 of that player's total game contribution.
Pobelter and Altec appeared to be fairly close.
 It'd probably be a natural move for him to go to TDK as well considering he can also speak Korean.
Don't think so, but neither does kha zix.
 They're thematic skins, not always indicitive of lore (or lack thereof lol).

 if it was IP?
All of these suggestions about how to make it permanent are missing the point entirely.
 The reason they want them to be temporary is because they want players to keep supporting their teams split after split (a portion of the proceeds go to their respective teams).
Icons sort of already work this way because they just slap a new year onto them.
That said it still feels crummy in my opinion.
it really doesnt matter once you start to get everything anyway
Later in the build most likely, overall the brutalizer not building in will sort of hurt and phage is not needed with the shield passive which while active gives Q and autos a slow.
he apparently went even with bjerg 4 times and got dumpstered twice.
 But C9 is looking for a mid that can beat bjergsen, not just go even.
 C9 and TSM have sights beyond just NA, people need to understand that
No, not if its only a friendly bard where the crash works.
 You would need 3 people
Morgana, Malzahar AND Heimerdinger all have 55% winrates.
 Should they all be nerfed too?
I think its pretty clear that Hotshot is more interested in improving his bottom line than getting his team out of the bottom of LCS

Awesome, the mental complexity of an 8 year old.
 Have fun making your quality threads.
Literally nothing vague about that.
 It's a fucking yes or no question if you want to spend money on recolors or not.
lol there would be a massive bitch fest going on if chromas came for zac before an actual skin
What is up with some journalists always using the player's last names instead of their IGN.
 Seeing "Abgaryan", "Pederson", "Tohki" is so confusing, no one knows who those are.
cool
It's been addressed by riot, can't find the post, they are keeping old skins as skins pricing would reduce the same amount as they always would over time as they are still skins.
LOL 
Well, when there's only XWX that can stand with Bjerg in NA, the consensus on reddit is that no one can stand up to you.
 You have 2 games against a good mid and the rest are whatever, you'll look amazing 99% of the time.
Holy crap that is so cool.
 Can it also be done with normal skins?
Actually it will be back for MSI, every World Championship skin pack (Fnatic, TPA, SKT and SSW) will be back for the event!
Or 1 empowered Q and 1 other hit from somewhere?
 Then you get incredible kiting ability with permaslow plus movespeed from phage?
 We are talking new Ashe specifically right?
The CDR is probably really good for her new Q, her new E, and obviously for her ult as well.
I'm failing to understand how this would be horribly offending
Who is he
Or iwdominate or Helios.
 Dexter was not great.
Or the abilities are on cooldown and you should all-in.
 Go after her when she last-hits with stun down.
At least they can win sponsers.
I understand.
 I'm just saying it's a pretty binary thoughtless skill.
 It has utility unlike Akali's E since the proc change, but it's kind of outdated compared to new abilities with passives and actives and steroids.

Just saw Yusui tilting hard on stream few days ago, while he's duoing with Balls.
 I think both of them have work to do on this aspect.
So which one of those are NA mid laners?
In ranked it is pick order > call order, but personally I try to let my teammates play whatever role they want.
 I'm pretty good at every role so if I have my teammates playing something they are comfortable with then I feel like we have a much better chance of winning.
 I could just play a solo lane (preferred) and force them into a role they aren't comfortable playing and hope to carry, or I could let them play their preferred role and hopefully boost our chances of winning.
 That's just me though
Haha, you think half the players in diamond and plat are on the east coast.
 The Average ping for diamond is 40 and the average for plat is only slightly higher.
I haven't played league in a long time but this just showed up on the front page.
 And I hate to bring bad news but this isn't going work.
 Riot has said if it's not worth the money to you don't buy it but the thing is it will be worth money to some people.
 And because of the price and how little it takes to make a skin they will make money if even a tiny fraction of people buy them.
 And there will be people who buy and honestly riot doesn't care about even the mast majority not buying it.
 In dota 2 for example there are skins that are 35 dollars and people buy them even if it is very rarely so valve keeps making them.
 This is a way for riot to extract more money from the "whales" and if you can't afford it well to bad they have made enough.
A week between playoff matches is certainly appropriate.
 That's also the exact schedule followed by the NA and EU LCS.
Garen, no mana, easy kit, lane sustain.
Honestly I don't have as much of a problem paying for Chroma's when they are for the base texture and not for a skin.
 The "Blucian" as I'll call it for now, is one I want to get, and will probably purchase at some point and feel the price is, while above what I would say is worth the value of it, what I will pay for this **one** in particular.
However I do think it's worth looking into other ways of obtaining the Chroma's outside of RP purchases.
Think of it this way.
 If there are people willing to spend money on something as basic as Chromas then they will eventually come up with something even more basic that they put out for RP.
 Its basic business practices.
 how low can you go.
Don't listen to that Wiz Khalifa song, while watching the entire clip then.
Its aram.
 I'm pretty sure riot are not trying to make it a strategic slow paced mode.
 Its a free for all and that's what its meant to be.
 This helps meet that goal.

I love how they teased Bard using summoners Rift, the 3 little icos that would glow on the map.
 That would be awesome if they did something similar.
 However I think with this update on the baron pit they just wanted to give it more structure and a "dangerous" vibe.

Not a joke, but completely outclassed by incarnati0n
Edit: Damn the downvotes.
 And look whose picked up by C9?
 Even in the article stated he had more "raw talent" than anyone else who tried out for the team.
 How is this a shocker to anyone, lol?
Or maybe most people are aware that ducks aren't particularly high up on the menu of a wolf.
Nope.
I would argue that Steelback performed great for how out of nowhere he came, but if you look at his performance an Rekkles one he just is not as good.
Just because fnatic won the split doesn't say they should rest on their laurels and I also think Rekkles now had time to grow a bit more mature.
 Still he is really young but he has seen how bad things can go.
I hope for Steelback to find a good team aswell, but he arguably was one of the weaker ADCs in the league
The safest statement they can possibly make because it sounds great, but they know 1,000 idiots will still buy it by the bundle for every 1 that is interested but shows restraint to vote against it.
 Then they get a free pass of "but see, you wanted to pay for it!

Too expensive if you buy it using regional money (REAL).
 Brasil economy is so good at the moment because brasilians dont like to use foreign money, at all.
hextech first back 100% like the revolver its something you have to have, i actually get kinda weird with it and run spell vamp quints and 9/9/12 masteries for the 9% starting spell vamp making it 21% spell vamp with the revolver but thats not really needed but the point is you need revolver 100% first item
i usually find once i get my revolver if im even at that point morde just takes off, imo once you get 1200 for revolver you back and get it and try to farm up to 1600 for second back at least and get a rod for the 80ap
boots 4 start btw almost always unless cloth 5, your goal is to outlast and out push your lane opponent, but i max E and have a weird playstyle i know some ppl like maxing W but thats my 2 cents
True damage scaling on Mark needs to be reduced.
 Late game you can throw it for meaningful poke, it does almost half as much damage as ignite, in a burst, at long range, every 20(?
) seconds.
 I was able to snipe kill low health targets with it which seems dumb.

Something you have to realize is that just because you see a couple hundred people on reddit saying they don't like it, that has no implication that "no one" will buy it.
Lots of people will buy it.
 I probably will.
 I think its cool and like the skate shoes.
Also, saying that he can have his opinion, but then trying justifying that your opinion is somehow more "correct" because you're a graphic designer makes you look like a tool.
Regarding "Shyvanna has almost no losing matchups in lane if you know what you are doing": they talk about in 1:42:55:
Well, vlad top is a losing matchup for shyvanna in straight 1vs1 laning without jungle intervention.
Vlad starts shoes and health pots and keeps harrassing shyvanna with autoattacks and Q's.
 Shyvanna will not be able to trade positively.
 The best thing shyvanna can do is to push lane into tower, because early level vlad has large difficulties csing under tower, but in doing so shyvanna opens herself up to easier ganks and takes a lot of damage from vlad's harrass.
At the first back, vlad buys hextech revolver to be able to sustain E (AoE skill) spamming.
 Why?
 Because at that point shyvanna will otherwise punish you by pushing your wave into tower and then go jungling with smite.
 However with hextech revolver, you will be able to clear the waves quickly with AoE, so if Shyvanna decides to leave lane to jungle her lane will be extremely quickly be pushed into tower.
If shyvanna decides to stay in lane, she autoloses, she cannot win trades and she does not win all-ins vs vlad.
Edit: so while he may not have many losing matchups, do you really want to leave the possibility of a vlad counter-pick open XD?
Except they're not and if they were, you'd be challenger (which you're not).
They should play Annie, second simplest champ in the game.
good waste of time kid
The first thing I thought was this is the start of the 2017 urgot LoL future story.
 'My team uses their mark summoners to travel halfway across the map and initiate a fight'.
 It's almost like an april fools joke, I hope it goes away.
You're missing my point, there is no way to FORCE them to support.
 They can always put support down but play a champ that isn't a support and have the same thing happen, but they get 2x IP for it now

 Because then it shows which champions you main, and you can show off your skins, and show off your personality with what kind of skins you get.

Witness what scared me shitless on Disney channel D:
10/10 rant you literally put my feelings into words.
I've been playing this game for around 3 years now and it still blows my mind when people whine and complain about skin prices.
 Skins (and chroma packs) literally offer zero tangible in game benefit, their entire purpose is simply a way for us the players to give back to riot, while getting a pretty cool (but useless) thing in return, that we might like.
My thought process for buying a skin is simple: do i play this champion?
 do i like this skin?
 can i afford it?
 If all 3 are yes then skin purchased.
A skin is 'worth' whatever price riot gives it.
 If i cant afford that price or am unwilling to pay that price, I simply dont buy it.
 Easy.
Because many EU pros said he would stay in EU so many people "lost hope"

Alright, so graphics editing tools usually have their colour picking and rendering of a graphic as HSV/HSL.
 These stand for Hue/Saturation/Value or Lightness.
 My favourite way this is presented can be seen as a box with a slider; the slider is your hue (colour from red to green to blue to red), the box's Y-axis is your value (from white to black), and the X-axis is your saturation (pure neon to no colour).
Our eyes do not work within such nice confines, and the natural pigments of the world and the way they mix with light or surroundings also do not fit such a nice little box.
 Your appropriate range for a yellow, like Lee Sin's shirt, can have very minimal saturation changes, but to make the shirt look appropriately red and not numbingly neon, you may need to have a larger range between the saturation values for every shift of colour in every pixel.
Simply colour swapping in an editing program doesn't accomplish this easily as far as I am aware, and trying to will only lead to improper colour shifts that look unnatural or oddly textured looking sets of colours.
 I may be wrong, but almost every example of a non-Rioter Chroma has had glaring issues because they essentially shifted the hue without adjusting the saturation and value.
Fizz is my favourite: his dreads on his base skin have almost no sheen to them where they are most illuminated due to how light of a colour his skin is, but two of his three chromas have very clear distinct light areas compared to the rather matte quality of the other chroma and his base colours: http://3.

If I'm wrong, someone please correct me.
 If you don't understand, maybe I can more concisely explain something.
I want to be able to see the indicators when I am holding down the ability key and when I release it it would launch.
 Basically quick cast but I can also see the range indicator for a spli second if I choose.
Ever since Yusui started that twitter dispute I've always thought of him as a twat.
C9 Incarnati0n hype.
and if that doesn't work - C9 Faker hype!
XY and ORAS were pretty disappointing to me, though ORAS less so, mostly due to the Sneaking mechanic saving the game.
 The games hold your hand entirely too much.
 They feel less like an adventure and more like a tour.
 They're significantly easier than previous generations.
 They just do so much for you that feelings of accomplishment are few and far between.
 However, Sneaking was so much freaking fun for me in ORAS that I was able to forget that stuff for a bit.
 ORAS still had huge problems with holding your hand, though, and I felt disgusted when that sort of stuff popped up.
XY's scaling and progression was just *awful* though.
 Your Pokemon are level 30 by the time you reach the second gym, and once you get to a certain point, all of the gyms except for the last one all come immediately one after another, it feels like.
 The Exp.
 Share also destroys pacing in its own right, which is in both XY and ORAS.
Jesus.
 And here I thought my 7hr drive was gonna suck.
He was 100 cs down to Altec in most of those games coming out of the laning phase.
 That is definitely a liability.
Games played *do* matter.
 games played actually matter more than anything.
 every game played is a chance to get 1 iota better.
 to use an RPG analogy, more talented/smarter people have a higher chance of getting better every game and may start at a higher benchmark.
 but if you ever played any sport or competitive esport you know no matter how good you are at video games if you play one game a week for 5 years almost absolutely anybody who plays 5 days a week for 8 hours will be better than you after those same 5 years.
the harder something is, the more practice matters.

.
as someone who's never watched any of the challenger scene games: what's with the yusui hype?
 is it real, or is it another crappy NA mid player that's really overhyped (thinking about pobelter/link here) 
we all know EU breeds mids.
 always has 
Dexter did really well, while having Nien/Seraph top & Link mid, he deserves more credit than you'd think.
Meteos was surely as good as him, but he had a way better team, shotcalling & even org overall.
Sounds legit.
Actually, the reason he picked up Incarnati0n was to try him out for the team.
 He hasn't been guaranteed a spot yet and Hai has stated that they are looking to try out anyone that meets their qualifications.
That dude looks sly as fuck, honestly so attractive full homo
Yeah but aatrox has very little else going for him with hos his kits designed (aoe and a GA passive as well as bring a sustain tank tbatcan do damage)
The only other thimg he can do is splitpush, but why would you sacrifice a tank, in the tank meta, when you can get a zed mid, who teamfights better, splitpushes better and is just generally stronger, while giving less up in the meta
rage quitter

Stop downloading porn while playing league.
Yeah I'm never going to buy these, and I currently have more than 2k RP.
 It's not worth it.
I have spend hundreds and hundreds, pushing a thousand dollars on my account in the last 4 years, never will I ever buy Chromas.
 They should unlocked other ways, through champion mastery, or with IP.
Perhaps remove the bundles entirely, and sell them at like, 40 RP a piece.
 Then I would buy a few.
I thought he was going to get hit by leona q and lucian to follow up.
This was infinitely better
Yeah what you just said is bullshit.
 Because the Puszu Yellowstar botlane were not a strong botlane.
 And they still went to worlds championship in season 3, and they still went far (they placed 3rd/4th, losing to Royal club in the semifinals)
maybe.
It's really not that bad.
please riot lets us buy em with ip, even a large amount of ip.
 I will not be spending rp on it.
I don't think Thorin is creating something that isn't already there.
 It's true that the average NA fan cared more about a relegation match between two bad teams than the finals of the most competitive region in the world.
STOP TREATING US LIKE RATIONAL CONSUMERS
Forg1ven doesn't like the team environment and is looking for a way out
As someone living in South Georgia.
 Can confirm.
Oh hm didn't know, thanks
I remember this creeping around when Zed was really strong.
 It was a pretty ok pick did well in lane and had a crazy mid game.
 Just easily punished if played properly.
I don't know if it's just me, but after seeing Heroes of the Storm, I like their method for chromas.
 In HotS, you can buy skins, mounts, etc.
, but chromas / tints are earned via champion level (almost like mastery), where you level up champions as you play them, unlocking chromas for the champion and the mount you ride.
 Seeing how HotS does it, I'd prefer to tie it to champion mastery, and I think a lot of people relate champion mastery to HotS champion level.
 That said, I'm sure I'd pay for a chroma that really struck me as cool.
Diabetes420
But those AD Annie though.
Jokes aside, I always hated Annie with that high attack range.
 How the hell can a child toss a flaming pebble farther than most bullets fired in this game?
I did that one killed me but I'm still alive and I think that videogamedolphin is a nice guy he kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything.
yessssss
kill la kill?
I mained Sona for a *long* while (and still play her on occasion), but she sucks to play that often because her kit is so boring and it's pretty hard to make big plays with her because her abilities are so cut-and-dry (which definitely works in some cases).
 Annie can make plays and peel for her ADC, whereas Sona's peel is limited to mashing buttons and running out of mana.
Also, people get really whiny when you don't use DJ Sona even though I have all of her skins and I think Guqin is prettiest.
He doesn't, which is why he got gold.
 It's not fanboy/circlejerk, it's mathematics and they work just fine, just because you're angry that you aren't good at the game doesn't mean the system doesn't work.
Yeah I know, that's my point.
 Riot knows people are going to eat these skins up because they were already convinced by the "Look how much more effort and work these took, you totally should give us more money!
" speech from Hippalus, because the guy's a genius at getting stupid people to think he's on the community's side and not the "Make Riot as disgustingly wealthy as possible" side.

 20 dollars didn't seem like a great way to waste hours upon hours of my time.
Forget about the wallet, I voted with my add/remove program section in the control panel.
They did trial Noxiak.
 He turned them down for GIANTS.
Kawhi would be the closest comparing to Bjerg as solo carry, Kawhi often outplays his defender in iso.
I wouldn't say Lustboy is Tony Parker, Tony Parker can pass no doubt, but especially for a team that passes like the Spurs do, he is definitely a scoring guard vs a traditional one.
 Very few point guards could be compared to a LoL supp player, besides like Steve Nash.
Yo, that's the ultimate gameplay experience.
 You'd understand if you could see just how good he is at typing in his credit card number.

No, it's just your recommendations are dumb and inaccurate.
 It's why you're a silver player, your game knowledge on top of mechanics are mediocre.
Well, Yusui hasn't been picked up by NA teams who have shit mid laners, but Incarnation is unbanned and probably has EU offers and C9 wants to try him out.
Is that enough?
 Or how about Yusui showing ok mechanics, but can also do quite poorly vs other weak challenger teams.
 While Incarnation is showing of some insane mechanics and outplays everytime he plays.

 Is it a handicap for Jesse Perring?
It's similar to how sports is.
I assume that if EDG wins, Travis will call Deft the best adc in the world, and if GE wins (assuming they win the playoffs) Travis will call Pray the best adc in the world.
 Though hypocritically he wouldn't call Wildturtle or Steeelback the best adc in the world if their team won the tournament.
Shes got some of the highest base AA range in the game.
 Most mages have a range of 525-550.
 A few (maybe three?
) are above 550.
i dont think cause draft is an american only system and lol an international game.
Riot would not expand something that different in EU for exemple.
The Koreans played that for a while.

yup, you always see comments like "the player base wants this, hates this, etc" on here just based on a thread on this sub getting 2k upvotes.
 Like take replays for instance, based off reddit's reasoning it's very important to everyone which I really don't think is the case, LoL has a 60 million player base and I doubt even half of those people care if there's replays or not.
 The thing is that while this sub is a small but dedicated miniority of the player base, people here are alot more invested than the casual player.
 I play a fair amount and I wouldn't watch replays even if they were there
i dont get it, even with rekkles they cant compete with eastern god adcs, why cant fnct develop steelback, this is his first split ever.

and also rekkles just been rekkles he is not getting better the only possibility is hes getting worse or stay at same level.

This is the logic of someone who doesnt play ARAM and wants to play ARAM to face plant.
 The mode is about being strategic to the advantage and disadvantage of your picks.

Dragonslayer Vayne.
 Man, fuck Dragonslayer Vayne.
.
FUCK SANGUINE BLADE YEAH
That's a personal preference, and where the fuck did a movie come into play?
 Also, who said it takes no effort?
As someone with over 3000 games of ARAM, I must say this spell has massively improved the mode.
 The worst shit in ARAM is sitting there watching stupid ass poke champions actually play the game while the short ranged guys just have to sit there and take it up the ass.
 With this new spell, ARAM is just a constant brawl with lots of fighting and killing.
 It's fun and exciting and pretty much all champions are useful now.
 I'd much rather have the current balance than the type of bullshit where "fun" consists of dodging Nidalee spears.
Who the fuck is saying they lucked out?
 They worked hard for it and I think this is the strongest they've looked EVER.
 But you're trying to make a point where there isn't one.
 Objectively, IEM was just every team not performing to the standard of their regular season form.
 This may be due to pressure, jetlag or whatever excuse but the fact that they had not been playing their best is an absolute truth.
 Did you watch those matches really?
 Can you honestly say they didn't underperform?
If you can then you're really absent minded, mate.
I don't see how this is an example of how life works.

this, said the same thing earlier, if it costs ip for skin chromos then riot might even make more money for people wanting to buy the specific skin which costs more
>An alternative to Chroma packs that should please everyone
.
>How about making TSM-packs.
Are you that ignorant to think that everyone are TSM fans?
We're all laughing till we see in 2 months Varus Jungle being meta from his ultimate level 6 gankerino powers
The NA fanboy in me wants Yusui to be the one chosen, but I'm still pretty hyped about Incarnati0n.
 I'll be *very* surprised if Yusui wins out.
 The only real way I see Yusui winning out is the current members of Cloud9 absolutely *hating* Incarnati0n as a person.
I know i am in a small minority, however if Chroma's are given via Mastery of champion i want the options to refuse/reject them.
 It's not about money.
 I simply don't consider them skins and i don't want them on my account.
 *This sounds harsh i know, i just don't know how to word it differently.
 Please don't take offense to the wording.
*
For the whole .
5% of the time that happens, sure
I disagree.
 It is nonsense.
 The game is completely chaos now.
Aram was fun to make me learn new champs and have fun.
 There's no learning now because it's mindless diving.
 Not fun at all.
Not saying it needs more range.
 Just that its frustrating how it functions.
 I'd trade a shorter fear for a shorter duration of the tether any day though.
 Because its always feels like eternity waiting for them to be feared.
Also are you a Pokemon?
Meteos with the new mechanics by flashing to reset the auto spacing on the blue buff.
That's awesome.
It's probably done like that because the missiles in the E animation are the same as the ones in his AA, rather than it being specifically intended.
Still cool though.
Why?
 Let me get inside the head of a purposeful feeder
Difference is tabbz and rekkles had very different styles.
 Steelback and Rekkles however have the same style, never mind the fact that Rekkles was previously on the team.
ty fam, >3
I'm glad to have seen some similar opinions to my own floating around.
 Everyone always say vote with your wallet, but its always structured as "vote with your wallet, but if you vote different to me you're a god damn fool".
 The chroma's are $4 worth of RP or something?
That's the same price as my morning coffee.
that is such a low price barrier.
 Peoples perspective is obviously different to mine on how cheap that is.
Elements probably only want him as a sub.
But they aren't skins.
.
 They're just recolors.
.
When I say competitively I am talking about at a pro or semi pro level.
 Most don't do that.
There are quite a few people who've been following Bischu for years.
 He has always been an incredibly good player, who's plays a little too defensively.
 Think Easyhoon, only playing assassins.
In the past, he has been a top 3 mid laner NA.
 I don't know where he is now, because he basically disappeared for a year, and even then, the NA scene was severely lacking mid laners.
 It's still nice to see some kinda native talent with the potential to do well.
That would make Bjergsen the Edison, and POE the Tesla.
 Bjerg took the urgod and now the Varus.
AGREED.
 i was using the victorius ward skin for months and never realised it was a skin until my friend asked me
Championsuggest: na oh eye see
the icon is to celebrate dignitas victory ?
Could be it, but I can't see why they wouldn't just say so
hmm, you must follow different people on twitter than I do.
I like the idea of Chroma pack.
 I currently do not like the selection given to me though as they're champions I don't really play a whole lot.
The only way i'd do that and the only way it would make sense is if 50% of the profit goes to that team.
So let's say i love TSM and they are doing great this split, pay for it, show you are a die hard fan.
 They get something, you get to show your support and rito gets to rake the cake.
Shame Pool Party isn't as cool as Iron Solari, right?
But really, both skins are phenomenal.
 I had a choice between the two of them when I bought my Leona skin, and went with Iron Solari.
 But I think Leona has some of the neatest skins of any support.
I guess what I'm saying is ???????? Chromas or Riot ???????? 
Oh?
 I don't have any understanding of colour theory from a design perspective, so I'd be curious to know why you say this.
unpopular concept, i know!
Yeah but arguably he didn't perform as well as Rekkles did before.
I, too, play GTA V
if I was a Fnatic fan, I wouldn't be anymore.
 It's a pretty greasy move
I agree with it completely went into a game with 5 melees also all of them had reliable cc it sucked as graves.
/edit grammar
I kind of want this to happen to decrease what seems to be emotion-less benching just to improve the team slightly.
 Loyalty shouldn't be a big factor when it comes to developing a good team, but it's still a factor.
 Ruthless benchings of people to be more competitive does work, but it has a price, a price that will make many teams worse than before.
 This is just in general.
 A team doing this might be just too damn greedy, might not even factor all the adverse side effects that make occur like poorer morale because players feel less secure.
 However, speaking about Fnatic, I can't see another Elements happening.
 Fnatic still has the same balls-to-the-wall play style, and a reliable, superb team fighting ADC can only help them.
 People spoke about gold distribution.
 Overall, it's still okay.
 What may correlate with gold is ego though.
 If too many people argue about who gets what gold, arguments can occur and grow into a toxic team environment.
 Is this worth the gamble for Fnatic?
 I actually don't know.
 I think I can agree on either side if asked during different times, so I guess I'm 50/50.
 First place in EU is great, but is that going to win you worlds?
 We'll see how the gamble pays off.
 :'( for SteelBack.
Jokes aside, this is a very good recap of conditions to try and recreate the bug
Waveclear is never useless, there are worse abilities
haven't played aram since the patch, you mean it's a lee sin q that can't be knocked up/back/aside?
10/10
Thank you for your advice, here are the specs.

60 GHZ.
I don't have anything on my pc.
 mostly documents.
 When i use it for research or even watch youtube videos for hours, it doesn't get hot but rather just a little warm 
I know OP is a TSM fan because of his taste in music.
 And also Bjergsen.
Your system would straight out give more crits so it's unlikely they are using that, more likely they are using something like [DotA](http://dota2.
gamepedia.
com/Pseudo-random_distribution?
cookieSetup=true)
They never said what distribution they use but they did say they changed the RNG formula for crits to be more "fair" in some old patch notes (Renekton patch ?
).
And it is glorious

If you're being serious that doesn't change the culture of where you grow up.
 If people in Korea tied their shoes a certain way, Jwaow wouldn't just because he is Korean.
 He grew up in Scandinavia and would learn things the Scandinavian way, not the Korean way.
downvoted
What about Iowa :(
She had 625 range as a mage.
 What other mage has 625 AA range?
 That is more range than most ADC's.
 Dropping it down to 575 is **far** from a massive nerf.
 She outranged every mage by almost 100.
 That is a huge difference.
 Laning against her was a nightmare because she would hit you twice before you even hit her once.
I think the AA nerf is warranted.
 Either drop her AA range to a reasonable value, or increase the range of every other ADC and mage who are at 550-575.
Good thing Incarnati0n never played 1 game in Korea soloQ or GBM would change his mind

FYTY
I think it is clear that finding a support is really difficult in team builder.
 It is not uncommon to have to wait 10+ minutes.
 I think this would be an easy solution if it was limited to bot lane support.
 If people argue that this enforces the meta, the meta hasn't really changed in terms of supports going bottom ever.
 (ignoring lane swaps)
Waiting for the good news, it won't be funny if c9 doesn't pick him and send him back though wish incarnation best of luck for the trial

Looks more like his support is spoon feeding him kills.
 He's still really good!
 But that Thresh was setting up some great plays.
if you dodge you actually do not lose mmr, so a way to skip divisions is to dodge your series and get back into them.
 if you do this enough, your mmr will be the same.
 the amount of lp you lose is based off of the amount of games you dodge per day.
 riot just prevent you from re-queueing to prevent people from just dodging and re-queueing just because they dislike their team comp.
Damnn, that's really cool.
 I wonder how many other interactions there are between other champs in the game that most of us don't know about.
I'm glad you have statistics here but regardless any amount of people you remove will lower the overall skill.
 That's the point.
It was great in the poro King mode because of the magnet affect the king had and the spamming nature made since because you needed to summon the king.
In basic ARAM though it is way too short of a cool down and the fact you can barely see it makes it really difficult to play against.
A longer cool down would make the spell much better and viable on less champs which would be better for balance overall.
But then again, it's only been a day so.
> People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want.
If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle, I'm going to throw out a simple point.
People ought to be *able* but they should not ought to be *inclined.
* 
'Bitching and moaning'?
 I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity.
 If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently.
 But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.
Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this.
 I'm not assuming anything of you.
> The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.
I didn't call them assholes.
 I'm quite careful with things like that.
I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it.
 I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.
> It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it.
 But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.
For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game.
 That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - "argument against the man") I'd like to refute it.
 In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that "Free-to-play" refers to those who choose to play it that way.
You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist.
 Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case?
 Maybe, I don't know.
 But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.
Same for any one player who does it now.
 The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.
> As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.
You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.
You do not gain entitlement through spending money.
 You do not gain possession of the game through spending money.
 You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.
Why would you?
 It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll.
 That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning.
 Does it always get heard, though?
Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.
If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down.
 Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?
If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now.
 The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.
So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like.
 But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.
> It's not being an asshole to say your mind.
Never said it was.
> It's not being a douchebag to complain.
It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day.
 Could be plenty of things.
But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something.
 People 'bitch' everyday.
 To people they know can't resolve the situation.
Going to Reddit?
 Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.
But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as "ridiculous", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.
> It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.
You have way too much "consumer empowerment" going through you right now.
> And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say "Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced.
 Heroes of the Storm has it for free.
 Make it the way I want it.
".
In other words, you're self-entitled.
Which is fine.
 But I'd rather go about it some way like this.
"Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well.
 But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this.
It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too.
 I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices.
 I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.
"
Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.
00 by themselves the *majority* of the time.
 Only Ultimate skins are like that in League.
If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?
*And* it has micro transactions?
Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA.
 Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.
You're getting downvoted for a reason, there are a lot of people like me here that think people that say "whoooosh" are just annoying and add nothing to the discussion.
You could've always filled the guy in because he clearly missed the joke, but no.
 What do you do?
 You decide to mock him

Dade man
In the patch that she was nerfed they also added Cinderhulk, buffed Urgot, and buffed Righteous Glory.
 And of course around this time Hecarim was gaining popularity.
 Teams started wanting more overtime damage rather than single target burst.
 Watch SKT vs Jin Air on what I think was the first 5.
5 patch where SKT outclassed them in picks and bans where GBM picked Liss and SKT had all tanks and had a more scaling team-fight focused comp.
 And then everyone copied them, Vlad gained a lot of popularity because of consistent damage/takiness/good team fighting.
 And then Vlad became the new flex pick for mid and top.
 So Liss is still played but outclassed in the current tank meta to other picks.
maybe this is the fnatic he wished for in the first place.
 i hope so because the reason i was a fnatic fan was cyanide and rekkles
Yeah well you wouldn't want to make them *completely* identical champions, now would you?
Except new Ryze, not so much.
That literally means nothing.
 They're two completely different projects from Riot, there is no reason they couldn't join the two in any way they decide.
Launching the skin changes literally means nothing for how they might decide to use it with anything.
It's a reference to Doki Doki Precure and Madoka Magika you uncultured swine

He's moved onto Chiefs, which means (unless they're making a challenger team, which is unlikely) that the 5th longest unchanged roster in LoL will have come to an end.
 [Post by /u/ajsadler](http://www.

com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/32cnfd/alltime_teams_with_the_longest_unchanged_rosters/)
I know he is a popular mid pick again, but as a top laner he also is a huge problem to many champions.
 his kit is toxic and too easy.
 huge knock up cicrle, easy to land silence and a ult that deals ridiculous damage + free health.
 He definitely needs some nerfs, how hard is another question.
 Killing him early isn't as easy as many will have it to be either, since the minion wave protects him very well, and they deal tons of damage @ lvl 1-2.
 After he gets his knock up he will harass the crap out of you with silence + stun combo.
 The only way you can really stall his late game is by asking for ganks, and lots of them early game.
 Because chances of killing him on your own if he's even a little bit good, is quite low.
If that's the solution to counter a champion, I suggest he might be a little bit too op.
Ah, yeah, you're right.
 I keep forgetting about how weird muramana interactions are in this game.

Yeah we shouldn't forget that anything said on stream can be bullshit.
 People only seem to bring this up when it's roster/major announcements, but you raise a good point.
D
That would imply that a lot of them want college players, instead of wanting to import or buy-out contracts.
Who is the best adc in the world?
Cows belong in the grass of bot lane bushes, not the jungle
People do well with Lux, Xerath and a slew of other low mobility Champions.
 The real million dollar question is the learning curve a player needs to do well with a specific Champion.
 I'm sure a lot of mids probably have barely touched Varus.
 Whereas an ADC main will probably do very well going mid w/ Varus.
And cleaver.
you obviously haven't played it very often
I mean if the baron is free it makes closing the game safe actually 0_o only if they can't defend their base at all would you just push them in.
 I always go for all inhibs unless we get an ACE or 4 dead or their carries dead for some time to end the game.
I'm generous but not in the money department.

Honestly there is no other ADC I would have in the west at worlds rather than Turtle.
 Turtle may fuck up in the regular season but when it comes down to the clutch games when plays need to be made Turtle is almost second to none.
 Just look at last year's worlds arguably Turtle at the lowest point in his career was out teamfighting Uzi.
 And even in the series vs White he was actually looking really good.
 Season 3 didn't lose a lane as far as I remember and made some nice plays most notably on Twitch.
All I'm saying is TSM can win a championship with Turtle because Turtle will always show up.

 It was also the same time that scuttle crab gave you a vision boost if you stood still and sitting there autoing a turret as valor would give you vision making his split pushing amazing.

If he never wants to play professionally again then sure, what could ever go wrong with telling the world that you are as mature as a middle schooler?

I'm a huge attitude era wrestling fan and I can tell you they aren't traded randomly.
 Everything in WWE is written and scripted.
 The storylines, the feuds, who wins each match, everything.
 Some of what goes on in the matches is real, like the slams and stuff, but it's all scripted.
 It's most likely the writers and wrestlers themselves that choose which show they want to go to.
I dont see how this is news to anyone.
 Hai said it already in his AMA, on his stream, the dailydot said it on april first and again after Hai's official announcement, there was a thread about it this morning saying Incarnati0n just left for NA for the C9 tryouts.

Well.
 you can say QWEER_REQER, but it's not really related to Europe.

 I am constantly striving for improvement and if you have any feedback I'm all ears!
I hope your day is going well!
Good strategies don't crack.
To be fair Hai said they are trying out more than these two, and said Yusui may be outclassed.
Why can't they just say what the actual problem is.
Riot specifically stated that the first batch will be money only to test the waters.
 There is a mighty good chance of a chroma or two being worked into the mastery system, or even other rewards for events or something special now that they're an option in general.
Of course that doesn't mean there wont be more that'll be available for purchase, of course.

Rp, or ip.
see, I stopped playing for a while after the third generation.
 I played 1,2 and 3 basically at launch, then the new x/y ones.
Crystal's what cemented the series for me though (that and fucking eevee man.
 2cute) Emerald did a good job reinforcing it.

lets start selling team skins too right
"I'm a hulking, burning behemoth.
" Makes sense to me.
I don't think he'll get the job.
 Personally, I want Arcsecond as C9's new mid.
 But I'd rather see Yusui or even POB than Incarnati0n.
I checked my friends mastery pages clicked home button went to click drop down menu for my own and i have his names for pages.
Sexual Slave Nidalee.
Weed Zyra.
American Gragas.
Tyrone Wukong.
Pobelter wasn't really climbing because of his insanely high mechanics, like Incarnation is doing though.
"The average person would have a much better chance of going pro.
"
Average how?
 Bjergsen is average in a lot of ways, but not in his ability to play LoL.
 None of those guys are "average.
" So no, it is not true that an average person has a better chance of going pro in an esport.
That's quite different.

Or you could just use smartcast like everybody else.
A broken clock is right twice a day.
 sry^doublelift^I^didn't^mean^it.
What does it matter if Lucian is wearing white, green, blue or even pink?
 Does it distract you that Blitz is no longer yellow in some games, but brown?
 Or red?
 Ofcourse not.
Why would they add a option to hide (Chroma) skins?
 What is the whole point of buying a skin, if others can just hide it?
He got a Fnatic-chair cause it's at gift from Fnatic.
 Same with the bottle.
 Stop being fucking retarded.
 Imma stop answering u now
Did you get to play the Poro King game mode?
 It is the special summoner from that mode.
FNATIC had the second best team in the tournament in their group, thus guaranteeing that even if they got out they'd face the best team at worlds?
 TIL.
No.
 Not even a little.
I guess this applies to playing with as well as against but, Guqin Sona.
 The sound effects with this skin irrationally irritate me.
 It makes my skin crawl and my fiance trolls me by playing with the skin all the time.
I was hoping for a homoerotic segment involving Sneaky's butthole, but sounds good enough to me.
There is a very large difference between criticism and being an ass about a potentially accidental undocumented change.
That's not an oxymoron, that's a pleonasm.
I agree except this is a fundamental game, like if they removed dragon or baron from summoner's rift.
 Any form of strategic limitation has been neutralized for nothing more than a cheap, spammable summoner
I don't feel its naive to say that its team hopping at all, every roster he has left has been publicly stated to be his own choice.
 I think that it is just rationalizing in his favor to attribute some shadowy falling out / dropping to his situation.
Your second point confuses me a bit.
 You are absolutely right in that he joined elements and it didn't work out how he wanted it to, and that Fnatic now want him back.
 However I don't see how those are pertinent points to the idea that he is simply following success rather than creating it.
 They want him back, but that doesn't mean he isn't riding on their coattails (to take steal your phrase).
Don't mistake this for hate, I do not dislike Rekkles (although his social media interactions leave a LOT to be desired).
 He is an extremely gifted player and I hope he does well on Fnatic (big yellowstar fanboy), but I think that my opinion is pretty justified considering the kind of information that has been released to the public.
Ya me too, i heard he dumped fusion multiple times, him and meteos double killed tsm mid once and other than that he was pretty average, also Lan > Scrims
IT'S BLACK GOLLY WHAT ARE YOU BLIND^^^^^JK ^^^^^I ^^^^^KID
cause fuck zac, thats why.
Some reason I thought the bubble would be frozen, I dont play nami.
That would require them to make a skin for Yorick, and you know that ain't happenin'.
If you dodge your series every time you get it but continue to win games, your MMR will go up.
 Eventually, if your MMR gets too high for your division, you will be automatically promoted.
Honestly I don't find the new black cleaver to be that good on AD carries at all.
 3K gold for 40 AD is extremely inefficient.
 You will be setting your build back by a lot.
 BF sword gives more AD and is half the cost.
 So I doubt its good on the likes of lucian, graves, sivir, jinx, kog, vayne.
Ad carries I would consider cleaver to be ok on: Corki, Ezreal, Ashe (pre rework), Kalista.
Its good on Kalista because she can build Bork -> Runaans -> Cleaver, with you proc'ing the armor pen on runaans bolts, and you still do damage.
 Its good on Corki/Ezreal because missiles/q will apply cleaver.
 Ashe because low CD arrow.
However, ADs depend on having IE, AS item, LW for damage, and 3K gold is too big to just use on 40 AD and CDR + phage utility.
Also please please please don't go cdr boots on lucian, they were ok last season but now you really want to be playing him like an actual adc.
 You will do more damage with AS boots, and you shouldn't be using e off cooldown anyway
You say that but at the same time he's been on an shitily managed team his entire career in LCS.
 I'm not the biggest pob fanboy but i think on a well managed team he still can be one of the best mids in NA.
 People used to think Krepo was a bad support on EG too, just because a team is managed and coached poorly doesn't mean the players are bad.
This is most likely an upgrade, but it seems stupid when Steelback hadn't really done anything wrong.
 Fnatic played great this split and looked like they were only going to get better, but now they've mixed it up again.
 I'm sure it will work out, but it still seems pretty scumbaggy when Steelback did everything he was asked to.
.
Sorry for the silly question, I'm from /r/globaloffensive and this got to /r/all.
 Whats a Chroma pack?
 We have a chroma case and a chroma 2 case that just came out, coincidence?

 It's about improvement.
He was AWESOME on Yasuo, sad to see that people thnks he's bad on him now oO
Dragon Knights kill the Winterfoxes, Animal spirits further imbue the team into the Dragonfox Winter Knights.
LOL'ed way too hard XD
i dont get it explain pls :(
I can't stop the tears now, why do you do this to me?
This song is in my league playlist :0
Pretty sure he is based on Johnny Depp's Sweeny Todd
Give it time, lets see how Turtle performs against Deft and Bang.
No he didn't?
 He lost every 2v2 
You gotta expect that with this society.
 Mention ethnicity of any sort and people will disagree with you until the world ends.
 Doesn't matter if you have a point or not because "political correctness"
Well it's not like we can try out the product or return it of we don't like it.
 Sale is a sale and only feedback you'll see otherwise is through reddit 
Dade is in lazy retirement mode we don't count him anymore.
 Top mids are Faker, PawN, Rookie and Weiless.
dude bro they meant staff wtf is this don't trash on them, their roster is fine they were winning a lot early split
Well, it was picked last Summer Split.
Flash's counterplay is based on its cooldown.
 The counterplay is to play around it.
I thought the circle of fire was just gonna be like a "range indicator", and she would still be able to leave a trail of fire.
What's the problem with supporting teams that have been relegated?
 I've been running out my season 3 NiP summoner icon since that split.
 Kind of fun to be repping history.
I'd much rather they just sell the full lot at full price and never remove them.
Of course, then I'd feel compelled to buy them all.
 (I don't have a ward skin problem, shut up!
)
Again, I think people are not saying your points above.
 The overall theme is that if Season 3 SKT or Season 4 SSW did the above and more, they would still shit on WE.
What?
 I don't under why you posted that to me.
What part of what I said made you think I disagree with any of that?
Players in Japan get better ping then some of my east coast friends get
Don't think there would be a difference besides some sick wombos.

bLucian too sexy.
Why do you have to buy a chroma PACK?
 Why not just one Chroma?
 For instance, I don't want blue and red lucian, I only want the yellow one.
 I'll only use the yellow one.
 Why do I have to spend 600rp on all 3 and have 2 that i'll rarely/never use instead of 200rp on one and then i'll have 400rp free to spend on other ones?
 As it stands I don't think i'll be backing it.
haha
I just down voted all your comment history :)
NBA finals too.
Source: Vice E-sports documentary
But someone has to do it.
Seconded.
 I would gladly get a red one for like 200rp (since i got 410 leftover), but 590 for a pack I will only use in 1/3?
 nope.
I thought ashe was a late game champ already
do people actually just sit and laugh out loud?
 Dunkey is like my favorite human being but I don't think I actually laughed out loud once.
No team wants a player that will only do well if the team is already winning, cauz if the team is already winning theyre not going to be changing rosters.
 Winterfox started out great this last split, but then they started getting dumpstered.
 The thing about pobelter is he seems like the type who doesnt have any aspirations for winning LCS/worlds, hes perfectly content to be middle/bottom of the pack but as long as hes playing hes fine.
Rise rise to the top of the front page!
 Go my son onto the promised land!
Btw nice looking, might actually dl this skin to use after I watch the guide to figure out how.
.
.
.
I AM THE DANGER
I wish but I doubt this will happen most likely wasn't a system in place to count the number of games on each champion for every summoner.
This thread inspired me to buy chroma packs with rp.
 Refunded a blitzcrank skin then got a chroma pack instead.
 Yaaayyy
Yes, it's buggy atm but nami's bubble will never deal enough damage to take out morganas shield alone, except if nami is maxing her bubble.
Yeah, I know I'm only a single data point but I'd probably get Dragon Fist Lee Sin full price to start working toward the Chromas.
It's not.
 But this joke has literally no racial content.
I am indifferent to any changes on Shyvana.
 If Riot decides that they want these changes to go through, then they will and someone disagreeing with them won't stop them.
 Maybe a community uproar, but the bottom-line is it's their game and they can do what they want.
 They want this champion to be strong for a few months.
 then they will and vice-versa.
 If they want to give her a rework or update the way her kit works to "create clear and decisive counter-play", then they will.
Any change will effect a part of the community in a subjective way (agree or disagree based on their own opinions/impressions) but this is a game that is built on changing and adapting, for better or for worse; it's what keeps people interested, both old and new.
This will probably get buried, but if they are making chroma packs, they should put Rusty Blitzcrank back in the store
this has been happening for a long time now.
 given, not very often, but I've had games where i had to dc to use my q again on Vi
Is not only damage, is free TRUE damage with low coldown that also is a gap closer with more range than a nocturne ult.
 And exhaust don't help when garen chogath reksai can jump on you half of the map and just kill you slowly
Meh, I think Bjerg was already considered really good, ppl were looking at that team (CW at the time) and saw only Bjergsen hardcarrying.
 I mean, that team was 0-9 before Bjergsen came in.
Santorin, I guess thats somewhat true, but I think challenger series is kinda different, I shouldve clarified that I meant professional play only and exclude amateur leagues.
I always used wu when I'd get drunk and climb.
 You can't really fuck up playing wu kong 
This I can definitely confirm, Syndra is the queen of bugs.
 I main her along with Lux and I can say that she has at least 5+ bugs I can name off the top of my head.
 The stun bug is the biggest and most detrimental to her.
 I have seen her ball go right through the enemy multiple times in one game!
 I mean, her stun is the whole set up to her combo and securing kills.
 Not to mention her only escape.
Ever since they reworked her stun and Q damage, her stun has never been the same and it is honestly super frustrating.
 I have no idea why Riot has not acknowledged these bugs.
 She has even had some bugs that have been with her since she was released!
 Here are some bugs I can name right now: 
*Her W sometimes cannot be used again after picking up a sphere or minion which has costed me kills and farm.
*After she uses ult, she does this weird stutter walk thing for a few seconds that can be very frustrating especially in teamfights.
*Of course there's the stun bug where her sphere will go right through an enemy champion when it clearly was supposed to stun.
*If you use Q, W, then E it does not stun the enemy it will only apply the slow.
*If you use Q at max range and then E sometimes she does not cast her Q and she will just use her E.
Riot, please.
 Fix Syndra, for all the Syndra mains out there including myself!
You know you're replying to yourself, no one said anything.
.
Jealous of my new position at CLG black clearly.
Someone mentioned that it takes more than just a revive effect mid-journey; you also have to have some buff/aura/effect expire at the same time (in OPs case, the Ignite).
Yes .
 Their place has been taken by Machi for this summer split
Everytime he plays Bjergsen?
 In Bjergsen's first NA LCS finals, he destroyed Bjergsen.
 Hai died like three times total in that final.
 The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too.
 In regular series, he has always done just fine against Bjergsen except in this split where Bjergsen was clearly better because well he is a better player but he also got way more resources in mid than Hai did.
Dade season 4?
 Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks.
 It happens.
 As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin.
 As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning.
 That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.
Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays.
 They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient.
 He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane.
 But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.
Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so.
 I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai.
You can't really enforce that.
Wu had this before, I remember using it.
 And the point is that this ability doesn't work like other ability that function the same way, there is nothing stating it shouldn't work.
Every other activated item works while ulting as well, I can randuins perfectly fine.
Banana gods banana gods CHEF RAMSEYYY
No idea dude, again you have to take all those theories with a grain of salt because its from a non-reliable source.
He changed that attitude a while ago.
 Read his pinned twitter post.
>Cause being a 3rd world contry really got in the way of LAS and LAN.
as I said, those regions aren't paying in brasilian real.
 I really don't want to give you a Principles of Economics lesson
lol genja wtf
I didnt say importing is wrong i was making an observation that na doesnt have really good domestic midlane talent when compared to regions like eu korea and china.
if ur getting shit on by a garen, ur playing this game wrong
2spooky
There's much discussion to be had, if solo queue skills meant so much then Pobelter would be a god.
 GBM himself said the Western player who he'd do best in Korea would be Pobelter, simply because Pobelter did by far the best in Korean solo queue out of any player who's ever gone there.
EDIT: Also want to note yusui has way less time to show off his solo queue skills as he is still in school and you know, actually plays on a team unlike incarnation.
Go to their AMA and ask there
and by generalizing the entirety of Reddit you seem to have done the same.
ITT: people who don't play a lot of aram.
Amumu/Galio/Wukong/Naut/Kennen &c already beat poke comps before this.
 Yes, it's good to have 1-2 poke champs on your team, but giving Wukong a 15 second engage is just stupid.
Sona (Shit ton of sustain, wins a lane alone and has no real countermatch up even tho she kinda sucks against nami)
I loved the changes they did to her Ultimate.
 I think the changes to her E was not needed but the Ultimate allowed her to force a fight.
 I mained her for a while and i felt her ultimate was very useless since my enemy would run away as soon as it comes up.
 I really hope they bring it back so I can try it out.
Edit: I just wanted to add that her new ultimate actually made her feel like a dragon and better fit her identity IMO.
"Hey guys!
 If you don't want to buy this, then don't buy it!
 Friendly reminder!
" Yeah, thanks man
although I agree, I've honestly been waiting for this Leona Chroma for a while and pool party happens to be my one skin that I already bought for her.
> But if you asked a random basketball player on the street to go against LeBron, he's going to get destroyed
The problem with that analogy is that he is only one player.
 If the NBA followed that standard there would be only maybe twenty players in the NBA total.
 Who would recruit a player who was worse than Jordan, Kobe, Vince Carter, etc.
?
 No one;
LeBron is in the top for a reason.
 There are hundreds of players far below him.
 Similar to LoL players.
 There are thousands of players who could compete in the LCS.
 It is just a matter of dedication and opportunity.
 There are players in Challenger who, while solo stars, are better than a majority of LCS players.
 Yet they are not on teams (for a variety of reasons).
My point is: You do not have to be the best at something to be apart of it.
 You just have to be in the right place at the right time, and show that you are both skilled and dedicated.
Well but Rekkles is arguably just the better player.
 Just because the team won doesnt mean you should not consider change.
 And it is also not like fnatic absurdly dominated this split
I think the nerfs here are not supposed to target support annie as hard as they are a hit to mid lane annie.
Support Annie is niche and in a good spot, mid lane Annie has problems with being a really low counterplay 100-0 champion like Veigar was.

Why is everyone assuming because he says he never decline an offer for a STARTING spot on Elements that he never received an offer at all?
 Elements is an org that loves having subs and it's fairly obvious that if they offered him a spot, it would be a spot as a sub.
 But nope Reddit circle jerk continues, OMG DAILY DOT IS WRONG OMG LORD VOLDEMORT IS A LYER AND HE SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF ESPORTS hurr durr.
step1: press play
step2: pick diana
step3: win
I always wished that Diana could apply her passive in an AoE if it was up and she used E.
 Think of the tactical plays.
 However, I think that would make her pushing potential way too strong.
People willing to argue on the internet are not representative of a fanbase, they're representitive of a very vocal side.
That's the old health potion sprite.
Do you even go to school?
 Jesus
Dexter was not even close to Meteos's level last year.
 Your comment lost all credibility at that statement.
You mustve dodged a game
tbh I have absolutely no idea why they even changed her E to begin with.
 Her E procing the Q was not what made her strong, but it made her kit feel like it worked together a lot better.
 Her damage on Q proc or her ulti damage were what needed to be changed.
 She feels a lot clunkier since the E was changed.
championsuggest: euw charnet159
Not again lol
This right here.
 I would actually have something to spend my excess IP on.
 I have over 100k, owning all champions, runes and 20 rune pages.
At 6 items each, the tank will die before the adc dies to thornmail unless the ADC is eatting additional damage and essentially facetanking the tank.
Also, that isn't actually true.
 It was Maokai, Rek'sai, Lulu, Lucian, Annie.
 That isn't a traditional jugger(lucian in this case), just cause it has a Lulu doesn't mean the adc goes from shit tier can't touch a tank to god tier can practically 1v5.
SKT will then build Faker 2.
0 and at worlds it will be C9 with Faker Prime vs SKT and Faker 2.
0
I try :)
I can't take your opinion seriously.
 Most of the recent 750 skins have been awesome.
 I'm loving my Sivir and Ashe skins and the new 750 ones on the PBE are pretty cool too.
Also, I know for a fact that Riot employees have already addressed people thinking that this is just an issue of "moving a slider".
 It's not, and especially so for Zac.
I thought my post was rather clear to begin with but okay, apparently not.
 Thanks for pointing out that I do have a choice in terms of picking it but that's rather irrelevant if 8 out of 10 players choose to pick it.
 It's not optional at all in a broader sense, the Spell is being forced deliberately into the game mode and there's nothing I can do against it.
 It's changing the entire dynamics of a game mode I fell in love with and yes, I'm upset about this.
 Again, I don't play anything else but ARAM, i.
e.
 no Ranked, no Normals, not even Bot Games because I simply don't care about stuff like laning, farming, FOTM champs or Teleport/Smite on top lane champs.
 Why would I spend my precious spare time on something I don't enjoy?
 ARAM used to be refreshingly different, I'd queue up, get a random team comp and try my absolute best to make it work.
 Now I got champs flying around the map all over the place and that's about it.
I'm sorry but I really don't see how that snowball encourages a more strategic approach.
 If anything, it's a detriment to synergy and team communication, people initiate whenever they want regardless of their teammates, which is a recipe for disaster really.
 Keeping track of cooldowns is redundant now, because everyone has an engage ability on top of their regular abilities on a 15 second CD.
 Maybe it's just me but I fail to see how that's supposed to be strategic.
Feral scream death sentance and final spark
`he got kicked for telling froggen to kick Nyph and wicked.
 and he said Alliance wouldnt make it far with those player on the roster.
 so got kicked because actitude.
You're an all star.
Thoridus, Nervia?
Definitely not.
 Just don't play it in the oven and you should be fine.
Having a great KDA means nothing, you have to remember that league is not like team death match and more like a game of chess.
Because you've got a positive KD and a negative win rate it means that you're not using your advantage to press objectives.
 (Securing dragons, towers, inhibs, barons).
Although you may feel that you're good you really need to get rid of the pride that you think you're good player.
 This is your first step to improvement.
 No one is good at the game until they hit high diamond, only then you have a good knowledge of solo q.
So you need to be pressing objectives and knowing when to take them.
 If you don't deserve to be where you're at then you would have been promoted by now.
 Become good enough to carry your team, never rely on your team and never blame them either.
 Always look at what you could have done differently, instead of getting mad over sejuani missing her ult or something.
 That is how you will improve.

Well, UoL dumped Gillius for Kikis right after qualifying and it went great for them.
 Same for TSM, Lustboy was a massive improvement over Gleeb.
I think they should be paid a portion of the split salary, say 2 weeks, but no way should they be "immune" for one split.
I like the idea but lets be real here: You need the exhaust/ignite for the early lane pressure, losing 2v2 bot lane is not a very good thing to have it happen, and u got your jungler and sometimes top to do the job u noted.
Would Also delay support items like locket, mikaels and sightstone etc.

Never did I say Altec's a shit player.
 Just overhyped.
Want to know who I think is a shit ADC?
 Candypanda.
 You can quote me on that.
It doesn't work with Ashe's volley sadly :(
MF's W will most likely look like that since it's just a modified auto-attack and applies them anyways.
Lb is also worth a look, but.
Well.
 He's done really well on ori and liss and I think that's important to note.
 The only reason I bring up those two champs is when considering LCS picks having some ultilty mids in your arsenal that you have success on that's a really good sign for teams.
How do you go about adapting to getting hit by a critical strike?
 You can't prepare for getting hit by one, and neither can the enemy as it is a random element.
 Critical strikes can provide excitement, but only for the person who is doing it.
And in a competitive scene, the outcome of things should not be decided by that uncontrolled element, but by the player's skill.
Combination of not preparing, not caring, and awful travel arrangements.
 Had one of those 3 been fixed before the match, I doubt ge would've dropped a game.
To be fair to the critics, ge tigers is looking less and less like a number one seed.
 This meta definitely does not favor them.

Make it exactly the same as Lee Sin's Q.
So did the Jarvan/Thresh fire ring do insane damage?
 Did it have any other effects?
Shut up Nami!
Maybe even reset summoner spells.
His proposal does seem to pull away from her identity as a non-cc tank.
Shyvana is very all-in-y so making her ultimate un-flayable (heh) makes sense thematically but I think the reason her ult is considered a dash is because she needs to be kited for that exact reason.
 She's a high-damage tank, which is a VERY dangerous type of champion for game balance as a whole.
 Nobody wants to have a champion that can give better than they get purely because of their kit and scaling rather than any real lead.
Championsuggest: na Captainglorydays
No, while the ping would be better for all players, the regions themselves would be less competitive because the player base would be split.
 If you have, for example, half the challenger players move to another server, then less skilled people would fill the slots, etc.
 and your server wouldn't be as competitive.
No there are many people who don't want to see flaming all the time.
 Many people who get easily provoked by kids on chat.
0 messages is a good idea.
 Why not prevent them from chatting if you don't trust them to chat.
 You're still giving them a chance by allowing them chat after 24 games.
Currently they continue to flame and suddenly suspended and what then?
 They are back and doing it again.
 Or they're on a smurf doing it again.
 I don't get the point.

That isn't even close to being important to her identity.
Her identity as a late game initiator/burst mage has nothing to do with her aa range.
This was so intense, was sitting shaking during and after haha
It's not entitlement to expect Riot to throw a couple of crumbs (and that's a fair comparison for recolors) your way every blue moon when you've invested hundreds of hours and/or dollars into the game as well.
It's also insane to think Chromas payable with RP AND IP wouldn't create more profit than only RP.
 League needs more timesinks that properly reward players (CSGO and DOTA pretty much have the same business model, but you don't actually feel like you are getting milked).
Furthermore, it's straight up insulting that they are selling them in packs, which only cements this move as a good old cashgrab.
Just out of curiosity.
 And I know it's considered a bad pick.
 But wasn't a great pickup for him as Sivir since he was like almost their only source of wave clear iirc.
 So he would need to be spamming his Q/W without a blue buff like a mid laner would.
No, I remember Gosu streaming different ADC's and he only rushed Shiv on Trist.
 Most ADC's were already rushing IE and trist players still went with the shiv rush.
That's the point.
 I used a random rant complaint generator, you complained about spam so I gave you spam.
Lowest common denominator twitch chat style.
 I think responding to spam comments is also spam though, I mean how is any of this related to League of Legends?
You suck as a mid if you get bullied by Annie.
Chroma packs are so trash.
 Why are they charging RP for something like that.
 Use it for your champion mastery system.
 Greedy.

I've played with some chinese (idk why) dudes on EUW and they were pretty cool
Dunno why he's being so civil.
 We all know they went to pick Faker.
heh it's not bad if you're running Choice band Tech Scyther.
 You might want you turn instead of swords dance since Scyther is too squishy to set up well.
You might get ohko'd while setting up swords dances.
I was surprised they didn't donate some money earned by Omega Squad Teemo for one of the MANY veteran support groups considering it's basically PTSD Teemo.
No, its just her SFX.
He'd still be cc'd for the duration of the charm.
 It's just that the charm lingers.
Bro you crazy
Flash has no counter play then
Shhh don't be so hard on yourself, your not shit, you PLAY like shit.
I hope that helped >3
But but Annie is too tanky senpai
i dont understand how faker is in any way related to this conversation
i understand what they are trying to do, i just think its odd you drop a guy for "international success" when you havent played one international team yet
and faker is the exception not the rule to pretty much everything in league of legends
Dude, thanks so much I appreciate it.
Pretty stupid joke tbh, if you're trying to be funny try to have something mildly funny included.
I don't know how I feel about that.
 I think the effect would be too jarring.
 It would literally just be a character going full chameleon in game and that seems silly to me.

Okay first of all I know you didnt say that but looking at the shape of some players we can assume that many of them dont even go to the gym "XWX" for example he is cute and all but it does not look like he visits the gym much right?
>hat doesn't mean that if you want to be a pro you don't train.
 Koreans train 12-16 hours a day which is way more than the typical 5-6 hours a day an athlete trains
Dont measure how long different sports train on average a day since all of them will differ depending on what you do.
 Playing a physical sport is more challenging on your body then sitting in front of a computer (talking about the dmg your body takes) Lets look at Patrice bergeron for example in the NHL he played with a dislocated shoulder, punctured lung and some other injurys when they reached their second SC-Final and I would argue that is worse on your body aswell as extremly stupid ofc.
I am not taking away anything from E-Sports players I am merely showing the POV from the outsider.
 Mechanics are important yes, but look at Hai he wasn't at the same skill level Bjergsen, Pobelter and some other midlaners were mechanic wise but still C9 stomped teams because of their objective, rotation and shotcalling skill.
Reaction time is important yes, but [this](http://i.
imgur.
com/Yh2D0ew.
png) Is what I mean by that a silver 3 player had a reaction time of 236ms higher than the average challenger and yet he is still silver 3 and thinks he sucks at the game.
 What makes Pros the best IMO is their decision making ability and game knowledge of knowing what to do almost all the time.
The only reason I'm using the **physical** attribute is too show you what most outsiders will think, physical > non physical for most non-gamers out there and you can't blame them if you have no knowledge its hard to see what is holding us back from becoming the best.
Look at the guy that was on the front page not too long ago that said he will become rank 1 in NA he started his climb from D4 and climbed to master within a week was it?
 If people see that they will automatically think its easier to be the best in the world since its harder to find a "handicap".
 Are you in a wheelchair and want to better than Messi in football its alot harder but it wont stop you from beating Bjergsen or Faker in the midlane
These are my thoughts and I love watching LoL and CSGO pro scene.
 Like watching LoL more than playing it because of all the toxicness in EUW but I know pros practice alot to be where they are they are the best of the best for a reason and I'm not trying to take anything away from them I'm only trying to look at it from a neutral POV 
It feels like I'm back in school again.

In fact, Rekkles recommended Puszu to FNC because he thought Puszu and forg1ven were the only two ADCs in soloq that matched up to him.
 Rekkles also told forg1ven to join CW after he left to join FNC.
Nothing frustrates me more then the guy in ranked that goes 0/6 blaming the rest of the team for being "toxic" and "tryharders".

Confirmation bias, probably.
Do you mean 3v3 versus bots?
 Because player bots are pretty common on both 5v5 and 3v3 bots games, and that's not entirely Riot's fault.
 I have never encountered a bot player in 3v3 PVP, and I've got hundreds of games on that map.

That was quite the magical journey.
What I was referring to with H2K and Fnatic was taking a bunch of so-called random people, throwing them together with 2/3 weeks of practice and making it work over the split and with time and effort.
Ah well there's nothing that can beat the Koreans and Chinese at this game, so why bother with NA/EU LCS?
 In fact why do we even bother having this game played at a high level here when we know we can't win?
 Wait hang on a second, did you just flip sides and argue "if you're not first than why bother"?

except for maybe lulu those chromas would be pretty bad, and i love ori.
If by that you mean like 63% in a mode where people aren't trying so they eat an inordinate number of skill shots, then you would be correct.
 A vast majority of the time the tanks will far outscale the range in ARAM, it just no longer takes much skill to do so

Where's the rengar tiger tooth?
> they would of stayed with Hai 
First, it's "would have.
" 
Second, you imply that it was the decision of C9 to bench Hai and replace him with someone else, when the story C9 gives is that Hai was medically unable to play an amount he felt was adequate, so he stepped down.
I'd get Magus unless you're running AD Teemo with Blade of the Ruined King.
 He makes better use of AP ratios than he does attack speed once he either gets Nashor's (20% CDR just from it, too) or Runaan's, and either one gives him all the attack speed an AP Teemo needs.
 Keep in mind Liandry's is fantastic on Teemo since it constantly triggers the passive with each tick and will burn 20% of a target's health.
 Excellent for blocking off choke points and dissuading the enemy from continuing further.
You can do AP Devourer Teemo with on-hit effects but the AD build is honestly better for that in this meta since BOTRK takes away a percentage of health with every auto.
That would be true but we're talking about pobelter, so.
LoLGeranimo is really good at explaining ADC as he plays

In the current system you pay for both.

TSM TSM TSM I think I have poro ward skins idk ward skins aren't as interesting compared to real skins : RITO PLS my credit card.

i would likethose
And Rekkles does what Fnatic needs aswell.
 just better?
 I mean if you look at Steelbacks performance and you compare it to what Rekkles did.
 I mean Steelback is decent, but he is not as good as Rekkles.
This is not about hating anybody it is a sound business decision from fnatic.
That already exists.
 maybe you should go read it instead of contributing to /r/shitposts.

oh alrighty then, i just think a plat 1 would know better
No.
 I own an organization that owns a team.
 I want to win splits to get to go to worlds and increase recognition of my brand.
In the off season a bunch of players that will increase my chances of making it to worlds are free agents.
You think I should have to stick with sub par players because it might be crappy for them to get dropped?
This is all hypothetical but in the end NA LCS is a business.
Or he wanted to be a starter and EL were offering him a spot as sub
It's just like how Rekkles didn't fix Alliance/Elements.
 C9 needs either a playmaker (not really sure how well Meteos would do without Hai's calls) or some godly midlaner who can call shots and make plays (think Bjergsen.
) It really depends how well the team can play without Hai's shotcalling whether they want a playmaker or not, and how well they can adapt.
If you don't see it you are blind.

 I would really like for someone to watch my game play though rather than just look at my stats.

I would say zed.
 extremely easy to play.
 there's also riven
What makes you think people deserve anything like this?
 Especially when the game is already a free to play.

 Riot already offers the game free of charge.
 Options like these are luxuries.

 Then don't get it.

There was no
* Yes, but for a reasonable value.
* Yes, but only in packs.
* Yes, but with IP or by unlocking them through mastery
Elise is doing pretty damn well currently I feel like.
 She had amazing sustain and clear while still offering strong ganks and % damage, which is especially nice in this meta
Yeah, sOAZ is very clearly a player who is 100% instinct, and such players *are* difficult for more analytical-types to cope with.
 You need to account for their loose play and "give them space to do their thing," so to speak.
 I see that kind of player talked about more frequently in, say, Counter-Strike as opposed to LoL.
not sure if bug or not, but for one of my friends i'm unable to see how long they've been in game for.
 they are the only one that i've been unable to see too.

or you could grow up.
When all 10 summoners disconnect, it counts as a draw.
 Which means that the match doesn't get recorded in match history and there's no effect on LP, etc.
There are enough Zac skins already don't you think?
Rito pls 
I've been the person to shut down all the Yusui jerking because it seems really unwarranted, but.
.
Think about it critically.
 C9 may not really want the "better skilled" player.
 ~~Sneaky said on stream that they really want the mid to be the shotcaller and really replace not only the mid, but Hai's role on the team~~.
 Personally, I'd imagine Incarnati0n would have a better understanding of macro-style gameplay, given his time coaching on SK, but who knows.
 This year has taught us that it's better to play with players you're comfortable with and prioritize team cohesion, instead of talent stacking.
 See EL and OMG 
EDIT: Alright boys.
 I watched ~ 4 hours of Sneaky's vods from the past 5 nights (at one point I was listening to 3 different vods to be more efficient) and couldn't find the specific instance I was referencing.
 Other people agree with me in the fact that it was talked about, but there are some discrepancies among his exact wording.
 I'm going to donate to his stream to ask him tonight and he will hopefully answer.
 If someone can go back and find the past instance he mentioned that I'm looking for, I will donate $4.
20 to you on Paypal.
 Otherwise, suck muh balllz 
EDIT 2: Here's my cropped [screen shot](http://gyazo.
com/c62115c784b079c3b1c88df4c3a7ed5d) from my Paypal of donating to Sneaky.
 Stay tuned into his stream tonight because he will address it later most likely.
EDIT 3: **He Answered boys**.
 I'm not going to quote him until the VOD is out, but I'll give the gist.
 They are looking for someone who will be able to cooperate and work well with the team.
 They definitely aren't looking for a shotcaller and said they will most likely have to assign it to one person later.
 Furthermore he said that no one could fill Hai's shoes because it would be too much to ask for.
EDIT 4: Final edit, bitches.
 [Here's his answer from the vod.
](http://www.
twitch.
tv/c9sneaky/v/4556837?
t=253m47s) Text portion for whoever cares: “We’re definitely not looking for the mid laner to shot call.
 I think what we’re looking for is just a player who is just good at the game, confident in their play, and can work well with the team.
 I think the shot calling thing is just something we will have to appoint to someone after we found out an extra teammate and I don’t think anyone can fill that role that Hai did.
 So asking for that in addition to being a good player is just way too much I think.
” 
Also, shoutout to Idopefish(?
) who [said he will eat his penis](http://www.
twitch.
tv/c9sneaky/v/4556837?
t=262m29s) if they take Poebelter over Incarnati0n.
I don't know.
 I really liked Wickd's aggressive play in S2 but he really looks like shell of former self now.
 Whole split was pretty damn bad for Wickd.
Well.
 UOL is no joke.
The question is now if this is more due to fnatic being an overall healthier team than elements.
 I just think it is hard to doubt that Rekkles is a better ADC then Steelback if you just look at the fnatic games from last split and last summer.
QUE?
I love having warmogs/bt, but I hate the dash.
 I learned how to teamfight in arams and now it seems literally nothing in that gamemode is applicaple to summoner's rift.
 Really hope they either remove dash or heavily nerf it.
I wonder what they mean with 'needs to be adapted to our reality'?
they should be free you have to buy the skin for them before you can even get a chroma its like manipulating someones mind its complete ea bullshit tactics i have no respect for, looks like rockstar is the only gaming company that doesnt suck dick these days all others are gone like pandemic/neversoft
right in the nuts.
 dude dont do that
welcome to league bro wanted to quite lol cuz he lost his 11.
 promo to 1 afk and one jarvanorianna botlane lol he was mad so much until i carried him >:
Fair enough!
 Stats definitely miss out on nuance and immeasurables.
I don't mind about the Chroma Packs, but I feel like OP rather discovered a good Definitely not X skin.
For now I won't be buying any as none of these champs are champs I play.
The moment one comes out for Mordes base skin though its ganna be mine.
Are you 12?
Hell give her a speed boost on her shield throw or something.
1554 wins ARAM tryhard here, I really dislike it and I think we can't call it ARAM anymore, it's a whole new mode where the good'ol OP champions like Sona, Alistar or Galio are even more over-powered, we can even call them kings.
 It's also funny to see people saying it's a good alternative to poke champions, yeah, those players have no clue how poke champions get destroyed when the unavoidable teamfights take place in the howling abyss.
 I have no idea how they came to decide such a major change and how they thought it would be a good idea, I even think they did not think at all because, the stats of this spell are the same than the Poro-King's mode, the Ctrl+c/Ctrl+v could not be more obvious.
There are also a lot of bugs with the Mark, from funny fly-hacks with Rammus to annoying suicides when, IDK, the Mark marks the fountain maybe.
Somewhere, the idea of a dash/gap-closer is not bad finally, but a true-damage ultra-long range poke as addition is a bit* too much, for such a small cooldown, it's also a bit* too much (a bit = way way way too much).
 People are saying it's a strategic spell and it's not good on AP carries, yeah, let's take Lux, dash + cage, or let's take Morgana, dash + ult, even Veigar was using it to have the range to ult.
 This spell should deal around 0 damage(s) and IMO should have a smaller range and longer cooldown, around 40+ seconds it's okey, Galio would still be the #1 anyway, he was already OP without a gap-closer, so now I let you imagine .
 and let check the charts of the highest winrates in the howling abyss.
 The howling abyss did not wait for the tank meta to be already full of tanks, in fact they were dominating when people were complaining about the poke on Reddit.
Also, I think it would not even be a bad idea to see the Mark as an item's active, I never saw this idea yet, but somewhere, it would avoid everyone taking it with frenzy and only get champions in need of mobility to counter a poke composition would buy it and use it.
 I would be glad to get replies about this idea.
 My two cents.
BTW: just reached 126hp/s with Garen, did not have the spirit visage yet, we won before.
Because they reported you.
 How could Riot possibly know whether or not you actually abused someone?
 It's not a warning per se as much as just a notification that you were reported.
 They can't have someone monitor every game for verbal abuse and they can't rely on a bot to do it.
I'm sorry but we only use the originals, not the parts where there are several hundreds.
or you are talking about restricting the Polish.
.
 you wouldn't do that though.
 would you Adolf?
Lets be real, we just wanna see Faker vs Bjergsen 
so THAT'S what the smite was for!
I'm guessing that's the punishment.
.
If the game registered you as afk, not gained experience / moving for a certain amount of time you get the warning.
 Do it too much and they give a temp ban.
You have to make sure you don't get put into the AFK category even if you agree to let them win.
I second that.
Good one

Good guy Gambo.
In solo queue?
 There's no doubt he can dominate NA mids.
 In LCS?
 We don't have a damn clue.
So when is that Nidalee bug getting fixed.
?
how do you know why I voted for who?
I think the problem with chroma packs is that they're chroma PACKS.
It almost costs as much as a real skin to buy three reskins, some I might not ever use.
 I don't get why we cant just buy the reskins separate instead of in bundles.
>In my opinion, and many others, they should be a reward as part of the championship mastery thing
Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, its basically a skin (and ownership could deter people from buying skins) so i think its fine to sell it.
Making me buy 3 of them however is fucking retarded
IEM was a huge tournament, but the setup for showing who would make it to quarters, semis, and finals was terrible.
 There is too much chance that flukes, minor tilt, or cheese strategies confounded the overall results.
 Which is to say, TSM didn't necessarily win based off of luck or cheese, but WE might have won off luck or tilt(although spirit was impressive as hell), given there was only 1 series that featured a total of 5 possible games.
Thoorin did a great summary on the whole situation on his youtube channel.
 Because he was willing to say TSM did show great skill (probably the best in the west), but globally it didn't set them up to be a top 3 team in the world based on such a small sample and inferior rule set for how the matches went.
oy vey saving your good goy riot shekels?
 shame on you all its annudah shoah
what are chroma packs sorry?
I don't understand.
Gotta say, i love your username, OP.
I agree, his play style doesn't seem to really fit their needs.
Ok.
 Well the only evidence we have for Yusui that he would do well is based of maybe two or three pros saying he might be pretty good.
 Meanwhile we have almost the whole EU LCS saying Incarnation is on of the best midlaners in the region.
 Sooo
Stop trying to make Support Ahri happen.
 It's not gonna happen.
Holy fuck dude, how many times will I fucking see this comment?
 Pobelter is the exception not the rule.
 Most players who kicked ass in solo queue ended up being really good in LCS.
Faker, Rush, Huni, he'll even bjergsen came big into LCS right out of solo queue.
Just because pobelter has never really done spectacular doesn't mean "lol solo queue meanz nothing"
And picking up pieces of shit for HP!
Can you post a video?
well i guess not her entire kit lol should have been more clear, her Dragon form kit needs to change is what i mean.
Yeah even though they would be at a reduced price that's not worth it to me if I don't get to keep them for spending real world money.
 I like supporting my favorite teams with buying their team icons and even when they're gone out of the LCS, the icons are a nice reminder of the days they spent in the LCS and the good times watching and cheering for them.
 Unless all the money spent buying these wards went to the team I bought them for as a means of supporting and donating to them I don't think I would ever buy a temporary ward.
 Even then I would still prefer buying their icon which wouldn't disappear.
I think it really is about that much, but to be fair all their living expenses are paid for, so that's a nice addition too to let that 60k go much further

Its just a new meta.
Heavy grinding happens when you try to make a full team.
 HGSS has a pretty bad early game due to the wild Pokemon all being at pretty low levels.
ORAS was fun for me because of Sneaking, but I have a lot of complaints, and most of them are about how easy it is or how much the game holds your hand.
 I want to feel like I'm on an adventure and ORAS doesn't let me explore.
 It feels like I'm on a tour rather than a Pokemon journey.
 I met May entirely too often, and my Pokemon get healed for seemingly no reason sometimes, and characters tell me where to go and warp me places.
 Honestly, had it not been for Sneaking, I doubt I would like the game very much at all.
No problem dude!
Same reasons you talk about players of any sport: skill level and/or personality
My friend's dad is 48 and he plays, so not too old yet ;)
So i guess if a i stomp people in normal with garen ap support it'll be a thing

I love you.
Dunno, since I'm low elo I don't believe I was affected by those many times.
 Did a printscreen with all nicknames just for Riot to study it, if someone is doing it they will probably notice it.
 If they did it once probably they did it more.

 Read the clock plz.
Hah, I like you.
It was horrible a few patches ago, the client would crash every single game, black screen, dc etc.
 It seems to be fine now after Rito acknowledged the problems and fixed it I presume, haven't had a crash for a while.
I smell a good 1350rp skin out of this:
- Unique AA sound
- Ding Ding on Ult use
- Q could be like a superman punch
- W could show hands guarding a punch (proc)
- Back Animation could be boxing themed easily
- E possibly like haymakers
Fair enough.
 Maybe they'll nerf Malzahar too then, because the only counterplay available is either be Gangplank, use cleanse, or not be close enough.
 Pretty much the same counterplay Annie's stun has.
But seriously though.
 Like I've said twice now, I don't think Annie doesn't need nerfs.
 I'd be okay with the Veigar box treatment on Tibbers.
 I just don't think her AA range should be nerfed.
This could be just him copying what he saw on reddit
Even better yet, why not just have these ward skins usable whenever?
 I find it to be incredible bad taste for Riot to even be considering selling a ward skin that people who pay money to use cannot use whenever they want.
 Doesnt matter what split who is in, I should be able to support my team whenever I wish.
 In what other actual sport does this happen, in which a fan cannot wear and showoff their favorite team in any sport related function/event/setting?
 Thats like telling an 81' Lakers Fan they can't wear an 81' Lakers hat they purchased years ago at a current lakers game.

You support people voting with their wallet, but you don't like it when they voice opinions.
You're forgetting that this top laner was the one of best top laner that the west has seen during the height of his career, and that the jungler made a shitty CLG lineup with link and nien look pretty good, then held a CLG lineup in 1st with double before the team environment crashed.
 That this mid has played on stage, and certainly doesn't have an unclear character, everyone says he's a positive and kind guy.
 That tabzz is still really fucking good, and has won an LCS split, come second in another, and been to worlds.
 The only thing I agree with being "not superteam worthy" is krepo tbh.

Self control should be all you need to play an online game and not tell people to kill themselves.
 Maybe the should not be allowed to play, by bans, if they cannot figure that much out.

I'm Master tears so.
Passive: Being charmed by Ahri or stunned by Taric gives this champion +200 AD, +100 AP, and +100 range on skillshots for one minute.
I feel they rushed the feature too much.
 Most likely they will end up increasing the CD timer and it will become more of a strategic play rather than the spam fest it is right now.
Dude the NA talent pool IS DEEP.

You need to totally ignore KDA tbh, the only thing that's important in KDA is deaths and thats all.
Honestly everyone improves differently, you kinda have to watch better players and try to understand what they're doing and why.
 Then try to do them yourself and being mindful of whats going on around you.
Mainly though, if you wanna improve you just gotta keep playing and gaining experience.
They could just say so.
 And stated it in the Chroma Pack announcement.
 It already had the price back then
How is Lee-sin op are you deluded?
 also the reason why zed gets banned is because he has good in lane wave clear (not mana user) and immense kill pressure at 6.

I don't want to jump on the anti-rekkles hype train, but I'm not 100 percent sure this is the best thing for fnatic.
 Rekkles may be a good adc, but there is no way of knowing that he's going to play well on fnatic.
 Arguably, Rekkles's playstyle was what made him a massive liability on Elementz.
 While Huni might create more pressure on the map than Froggen did, Fnatic is going to just have to accept that a loss in kill pressure
If you agree with him and have your ideas about his laning then why do you need us to explain anything?

I can vouch for him, he's friendly with people who know things, he generally lets information slip when he wants to and he has always been right when he lets information slip.

Check the patch where smiting the large monsters gave buffs.

As your favorite and you're willing to change core mechanics for her to make her a differently played champion entirely?
To completely and utterly remove her entire ultimate kit design in favor of one that wont help her fill the niche she already had.
A design that's going to ruin her jungling, a design that will further hamper her laning and teamfighting?

Rekkles hopped the team once from Fnatic to Alliance when it looked like fnatic was breaking up.
 Basically every time before he stayed on fnatic.
 Even during his time playing for the Wolves it was clear he would go back to Fnatic so what do you mean by team hopper?
If the team you are on breaks up and you want to be on the very best team and it looks like the best team (and elements looked great going into the split) wants to pick you up, is it bad to switch?
Rekkles looked like an extremely ambitious guy and really which of the changing moves he did do you disagree so heavily on?
 How could he have known how bad elements would go this split and that fnatic somehow would be great?
I can see it vs.
 Veigar but how do you survive laning against poke heavy champions like Ori or Xerath?
I hope they win.
 So we can get skt leblanc.
 Fakers zed vs fakers Leblanc hype
No need with the amount of talent everywhere in the world.
This is true but I feel playing against other master players and still holding that win rate means he is indeed better than lets say a d2 player with 200 games and a 70% win rate.
 Im sure his win rate will decrease but itll still be much higher than nost people.

 It's a nice perspective to have, I think; to be paying Riot for what they've given you in experience and a quality time in League of Legends.
 It's one worth sharing, no?

If they lower Annie AA range they should at least increase her base AD so she can have better AA harass.
 She has high range right now but her autos have a huge windup and deal pitiful dmg
Yusui would definitely fit in with sneaky and meteos.
 They all have great sense of humor
Perhaps we, as a community, are so outraged that chromas become stigmatized.
 Nobody will be buying chromas for 60% of the cost of a skin (5 minutes of work vs weeks of work), if on top of getting crap value out of their purchase, they constantly catch flak for it.
I'm not endorsing flaming people who spend their own money how they wish, but it's likely to happen.

Chromas are colors.

 If you have LSI, you know that to change the color of the HP bars in LoL all you do is move a slider, that's all they need for Zac chroma's.
Zac's ONLY problem is NOT his model.
 It's that to make that skin feel worth it needs HEAVY use of many sound effects.
 Like Ice Cream Zac, Pool Party/Soda Zac even a Lava Zac.
 Zac is liquid goo by nature so his model will kinda be the same, but the interactions he has with his abilities and passives are all based on sounds.
They are too lazy lately.
 Look at how many unneeded 750 trash tier skins are coming out.
 750 is a scam.
 I might as well buy a recolor than a 750.
 They need to put more effort into skins.
 All skins should be 975+.
 Give us effects, give us a reason to own it.

Or you just need a single person to peel for you while everyone on your team with damage melts them.
 If the ADC is being left alone to 1v1 the tank that just jumped way out in front of his team, Mark/Dash is the least of your worries and you were probably going to lose anyway.
>3: If you don't get a comp that has a frontliner, then who tanks the snowball?
 If that person happens to be part of your back line, you can get completely rolled over by a champion like Morgana or Amumu.
If you go into the game with an awful teamcomp, that's kinda on you.
 No amount of balancing is going to make every set of five champions equally strong, and a well-balanced composition is almost always going to beat five of the same role.

> That would be pay to win.
You people make me sick.
 Anything that can be obtained and even required through free play isn't pay to win.
 Get off that reddit high horse and smell the reality.
Everyone shouts pay to win if ANYTHING is for sale.
 Of course runes affect your performance in game but everyone can get them for free.
 Let me go through that again for the retards reading.
 FREEMIUM means no monetary transaction is required to get the same performance capability as someone who paid but there are shortcuts/cosmetics for people who pay.
Whats the difference in playing against a dude with every runepage he wants because he's played 3000 games and playing against a dude who paid to get the runes he wanted.
 Nothing is the correct answer and before some retard posts well he 'earned' it - It makes no difference how someone got something when you play against them, it just matters that they have it.
 Its not like you get superboosted premium runes or some shit.
 Get over it.
Lets go for another example.
 You just started playing the hottest new fps but you bought the game 3 months down the road, everyone you are matched against has the 'preferred' weapons while you have the starter bullshit.
 Is that fair?
 fucking hell no its not, what if said player could pay like $10 to unlock a weapon he wants, is that pay to win?
 fucking no its not.
 Your logic is the dumbest shit I've ever heard and people love the fuck out of it.
Thanks!
fine by me, the "brainless" tank meta es healthier for the game
"o noes zed and leblonk are back to first tier picks" well its time to hide 3/4 of the champion pool because they don't have a blink to even get out alive of the fucking laning phase 
tldr: bursty dps meta had 1/3 of the champ pool that tanky meta has because if you are not a mobility creep you cant even lane anymore 
Everybody is commenting on Yusui or incarnati0n and I'm here wondering what the newcomers will bring us.
 Maybe they will surprise with Faker skills?
?
what's clunky about it?
 have you tested it vs his regular skin AA and Q?
 to see if there is any variation in cast time or anything else.
 Cause i don't think you would find any.
Thought the exact same thing.
Lee and Lucian are the only two that seem different enough to warrant spending money on.
 I suppose you could make an argument for Blitz, but meh.
In a teamfight, he doesn't have to be the one to followup.
 How do you think non-damage tanks work?
 And technically, the ult can be a followup on his q and e.
interesting levels of pathetic 
It's a basic question with a yes or no answer.
 Don't get mad and spout out ridiculous numbers to try and make yourself seem valid.
I would have answered yes because it's a good idea.
 Do I personally care enough to buy them?
 No, unless they were dirt cheap.
 Am I going to riot about it?
 No, but apparently there are enough neckbeards that are riled up about some fucking colored pixels that literally has no effect on how they play the game.
 Get lost.
Oh lordy ummm Nautilus or shen?
 If you want to that is idk how long it would take to make something like that.

Opinions are okay when they're useful.
 Yours aren't, they're just belligerent and whiny.
So have a nice day.
 I've spent enough time getting my point across with you.
He's complaining about people complaining about having to pay for chromas.
.
 Except I don't see any of those people in this thread.
 It was a good rant though, pretty inspiring stuff.
Because blitz needed changing for some reason
Oh he definitely does it as entertainment, I'm not saying he doesn't.
 I'm saying that no one is going to take TOO calling Ezreal bad, etc seriously.
 The difference I was talking about is that Thorin on his insight show people tend to take at face value sometimes, and sometimes it does come off like he really thinks some of his 'arguments' are true.
A simple "I have no response" would save you a great deal of time.
Of all the incoherent, semi-literate rambling I've ever seen in my life, your post might take the cake.
 It seems to be merely a long winded excuse for your inability to follow through on a discussion which you started.
 As with people of your ilk, you love tossing around statements about "racism", "bias" and "privilege" to the uninitiated -- yet cower away the moment you meet someone who actually challenges you to prove all the propaganda.
>There is no arguments 'back' because there's no arguments put forward,
Really?
 I thought my argument was rather straightforward, I'm sorry it went over your head.
 You stated whites could not suffer racism, and I responded by asking you numerous questions which would prove otherwise.
 You failed to attempt an answer at any of these, because you are either incapable, or found yourself over matched.
 Whatever the case, do not pretend as though they did not exist.
 You need to bit a more clever to get away with that.
>how much racism you must receive as a white male in the US
Never once did I claim to have suffered racism, only that whites are obviously as capable as anyone of being the victims of racism.
 Statements like these, which you attribute to me, yet only came from your imagination, make me wonder if you're in a healthy place mentally.
>It's sad and the fact that you keep deleting every post you write
Again I worry for you.
 What on earth are you on about?
 Deleting every post?
 What post?
 I have deleted nothing and you have only confirmed my suspicions.
>Here you can more on and ignore posts or delete them if people start to call you out or downvote you, in real life you'll lose all respect you could possibly have.
The fastest way to lose the respect of others in real life is to pretend yourself an expert on a subject, only to scamper away when called to prove it.
 When all your ranting about "the need to read" is done, we are left with only one conclusion: You have read nothing.
 You can rail against me all you want for making this clear, but all hatred is ultimately self hatred.
 I have read plenty, which is why I am willing to discuss this subject in any level of detail.
 Yet you are not, and I think we both know why.
 Perhaps you should take your own advice and learn a thing before you speak on it?
>I highly suggest looking into NPD and it's symptoms; 
Ahh yes, when all else fails, bring out the pop psychology.
 I fear this is more ridiculous than all your other comments combined.
 Did you even read what you wrote?
>"exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements.
"
You mean like telling me how well read you are on these issues without ever displaying it?
 You mean like blathering on about the multiple degrees you have on these subjects?
 I have said nothing of my achievements or talents, I have merely made arguments, offered facts, and invited you to answer them.
 Which of us have you actually diagnosed, my friend?
If we're discussing psychology, I would suggest you look into the term "projection".
 You're doing a great deal of it, and it's not terribly healthy.
My only problem is when someone gets downvoted and there's no counter-comment, or if they're just freaking saying their opinion.
I pretty much never downvote unless it's legit a troll comment or the spread of false information because I believe if someone is honestly "asking a stupid question" or saying their opinion (like "I think NME will do good.
") they can just get upvoted or sit at "one karma".
Downvoting them just makes no sense because they're just communicating.
Since when are we Fnatic coach too ?
 I mean we already did too much with EL .
They're also entirely different champions.
 They're balanced around different strengths and weaknesses.
Just because TF got a nerf over something *kind of* similar doesn't mean Annie should have the exact same thing done to her.
You might as well be asking why Garen ult doesn't do true damage, because Darius's does and they both spin.
For starters, TF card has a pretty low cooldown and most importantly can be activated on the spot.
 It doesn't require a certain amount of other casts to happen, isn't charged.
If you actually think her stun should deteriorate after a few seconds then you must have never played Annie.
 This would ruin the champion.
Annie bot might even stop playing her if they did that.
Uhhhhhhh

sounds like an old guy who can't use goggle.
Both Cyanide and Xpeke has said that they were thinking about leaving/retiring for awhile.
 You honestly fucking think that they would make important life decisions based off of a 17 year old?
Yea i gotcha.
 Just expressing my opinion that I dont like downloading mods because other people wont see it.
Is he gonna be a starter or sub?
 Cus I would feel bad for their current AD if Altec becomes the starter
C9 placed second in the region, how is that not "already near the top"

I hope so.
 I've personally got nothing against it anyway, as some of my favorite old skins are still recolors.
 I love Freljord Ashe and Stinger Akali.
 That said I still don't plan on buying any of the ones shown so far.
It's not all that silly.
 It's not as if they're holding 1v1's or that 1v1's even matter.
Given that it's a team game, the other team can have better individual players but they can function poorly as a unit, leading to an easy defeat of them.
Besides, without Alex Ich to carry, TDK would have lost.
 Without Alex they need to have some decent players.
 If you have no mid laner at all, why not take the decent, experienced midlaner that would be better than most if not any challenger prospects?
Literally what
It's been like this since the new jungle came in this season.
It says she's powerful, not the *most* powerful.
 I mean, if we look at abilities, Karthus and Veigar should literally be able to destroy the world.
I got the warning once as I apparently waited too long to com click around in between my dishes.
 But come on.
 that's a dumb system if it can't tell that all of us are sitting on the fountain because one of our players never even connected.
That's so fucking cool
Do you think Incarnation is going to want to play for a team like that?
 he seems very prideful and driven, much like Forgiven and I don't see him settling for a team that isn't already near the top of the region, that can compete internationally.
I've been hearing mixed opinions on Yusui so I don't know about that, but Pobelter is experienced and it's hard to say who the real problem on the team was when the management was terrible, they had toplane nepotism, and their coach swapping into adc and pushing the adc into support.
The whole thing was a mess, and we've seen in recent times players who the community regarded as garbage making another rise due to being on a solid team with good structure.
Seraph has been looking solid, and even people before this were saying Alex Ich was washed up and he should retire because he would never be good again.
 Now we're seeing him easily carry a team in the LCS and show some really solid individual play.
Just a couple examples, and Alex was styling on Challenger tier players so obviously there's going to be a little discrepancy there, but he looked very much back into form.
I think Pobelter and Altec both deserve another shot on a team that isn't run incredibly poorly.
 The person managing the team or whatever got into in relegation 4 times in a row?
 something like that.
Making players sleep on the floor, not having internet for a long time, definite incompetence.
 I'd be willing to reserve judgement on either player for another split.
I'll wait for you, OP, I believe.
Uhhh no video or picture.
Glad you're taking an interest!

Who is to say that?
 You haven't even seen him at MSI yet.
 That is purely conjecture.
Unbiased article is unbiased
That seems pretty obvious.
 I just hate that people have to make post telling other people not to buy something.
If I bought it I bought it because I wanted to.
 So what is the point in telling me not to buy it?
 If I do not think it is worth it then I would not have bought it.
 People just use reddit as a forum to complain about things.
 They need mass approval or else it just seems like senseless whining.
The stadium did not sell out in half an hour, I bought my tickets 2 weeks before the event.
A lot of seats are empty because a lot of people bought tickets just for the free skin codes (~$35 worth of skins and champions, ticket price ~$20), and also a lot of people - and I do mean a *lot* - chose to wait in line at the shops for a chance to buy the limited edition Ahri figurine rather than watch the games.
 The lines at the shops went all the way up into the staircases.
By the end of the 1st game, the top bleachers ("silver" seats) were about half empty.
Yea, but, why would he lie about being a guy.

Creepy pasta
First off let me say if your are below 1/4 health you should just push the wave into the tower and B.
 Don't play to risky, however if you are mid and your jungler comes then ping him into the enemy jungle and try to get some deep wards or possibly a kill on the enemy jungler.
 No matter who they are playing they can't 1v2.
 Another thing to point out is to watch high Elo streams of mid/jungle/top players.
 They almost always have an extra green ward with them, that way they always have the option to get extra vision of the opportunity presents itself.
Try to advise your jungler to either get more vision or get an objective or help another lane.
 This is assuming that you are both healthy.
 However if they don't follow your pings don't get frustrated and say something just do what you can do SAFELY by yourself 
I think by saying Kiwi is as good as BunnyFufu, you might have rustled some jimmies there.
 Though I agree, one good champion doesnt make you a high tier player.
 But then again, what does Kiwi have to be called mid-tier.
 I wouldnt say laning phase alone makes him mid tier when theres like 3-4 supports in the League that are as good if not better than him at laning, while also being better in like every single other aspect (Xpecial, Aphro, Lustboy, arguably Fufu or even Lemon)
Probobly start with something like Udyr, Olaf or Teemo.
if youre gonna buy champions with RP i suggest Zac because he is the coolest champ by far

is the train mission really impossible?
People blame the picks, Link, and the shot-calling, but even with those problems, CLG should not have gotten 3-0'd by the 6 seed.
 If a team consistently performs poorly in playoff series over the course of years, it's time to stop looking for unique symptoms in each loss.
 Look for a root cause.
It's not common lol it can happen in any country.
 And you don't go to jail you get detained and deported.

I think at some point there was a bug where you would get CS, but the +15 gold or whatever text didn't showup.
And blank color ahri.

Or full black ahri
You equate shit talking with what he did.
 He wasn't ever prosecuted for the DDoSing as it's very hard to prove in the court of law not to mention the different countries affected causing huge issues for what prosecutors might deem a small issue.
 His report, harrassment and ban rating was unprecedented among pro players.
 Then add the fact that he quite obviously didnt take his ban seriously and continued to play league of legends which means he didnt really lose anything from when he was permabanned to when he was unpermabanned from league.
All in all he has shown complete disrespect and I don't believe he should have been unbanned at all let alone reinstated in the pro scene, no matter what his current "attitude" is.
he's starting to take things a lot more serious because he knows how troll he's been lately
Don't we all know that?
 And that's your own opinion.
 That doesn't even relate to my comments.
 You sound just like the rest of them and only believing what others say.
 Do you think Fnatic is that retarded to break apart the team's current Synergy with Steelback that already works (even though it's arguably worse than Rekkles') and put in Rekkles himself that had ZERO practice and NO communication with this roster what so ever?
 You don't just simply slap Faker on your team before a major tournament just because he is mechanically better.
Jesus this circle jerk really is a joke.
They won't be free at any point, they will sell guaranteed.

Faker is on a level I can't even begin to imagine so even if he is on to something brilliant for himself and other pros I'm pretty sure all I would manage to do is FEED.
Edit: Oh, I do think if you can farm safely then midlane is a fantastic lane to have a Nocturne-esque globalish ult in.
its called a bug
I Don't believe in change in terms of on how your brain perceives (FYI my personal opinion as i'm not a neuroscientist, i may be wrong so don't switch the subject to that) and how you view things(you have that one way to perceive, is what i mean) but I do believe in that people can change what they do(habits, etc) that being said what he did was 2-3 years ago.
You don't think he has rethought everything and changed since Riot out of everyone unbanned him?
 in any case you should blame Riot not C9 if he truely still is toxic to a degree that is unsuitable, everyone is toxic sometime even pro players if you haven't watched streams and twitters, an example is when meteos and sneaky shit talk doubelift on auto-spacing.
I'm from England and im perfectly fine finance wise ---- wtf that is a horrible sentence.
.
not to mention your comma, which you might not understand how to use yet, so good day.
Misfits have a legendary mid, a solid lcs jungle.
 C9T have sheep.
First Blood Annie.
I can't take credit for it though, it's posted every time this thread comes up.
Yes?
I would have to disagree, melee teams could and can alway compete with ranged teams.
 In fact they just got buffed by having warmogs.
They polled the player community.
 We wanted this.
 If you don't, fine.
 It's ok.
 Everything Riot does doesn't have to be tailored to your wants and needs specifically.
 Personally, I'm stoked for this.
Yea that is why you stay in ur current low division.
UNIQUE: +20% life steal
UNIQUE: Your life steal overheals you, converting the excess healing into a shield that absorbs up to 50-350 damage and decays when out of combat for 25 seconds.
 So you can see the difference between Bt and ur support item!
I would say he's as good if not better than Forgiven.
You can't remove this core spell from Rammus lol.
 And sonic is spiky too.
i have almost 2000 ARAM games, and i love the changes.
 it was just getting boring.
You guys are forgetting louisxgeegee has a shit temper at least in solo q and maybe that gets to his teammates.
 there might be other reasons for them to replace him that reddit doesn't know about.
 i know, shocking.
Nope.
 New one.
 It's label starts with "sru" meaning Summoner's Rift update.

 the enemy gets lux, nidalee, jayce, ziggs, sona.
 you lose 100%.
 the enemy would have to go afk or be bronze 5 level noobs running right in to your turret to lose that game, especially if your team is like renekton, shen, tryndamere, warwick, mundo or something.
 they will just get mana and cdr and poke you down constantly.

Jerry Sandusky Zilean
Hes no longer streaming on azubu?
 Because i cant find his records.
Meh, Olaf has 0 synergy with Cinderhulk; it's just Olaf with 25% more hp.
 Olaf is the same Olaf since S4.
 While Olaf is a strong champion in his own right, he takes far more effort to do remotely well with without any real payoff, compared to just locking in jungle Volibear or Skarner, who duel just as well, but scale into lategame far better.
 His total lack of AoE damage is a dealbreaker, given he can't burst even a single target.
He basically has no teamfight presence at all.
 You have to burn your ult just to start a fight, which then lowers your durability as you get 100-0ed on your way in.
 If you're against a full tank comp, he's a strong counter-pick, but that's about it.
You're an utter joke.
 What the fuck are you even talking about?
 He's not good.
 He's middle of the rate.
 You can suck his dick if you want, not my problem.
the choice of jungle item baffle me.
Youtube is op
I feel like this would make Annie easier to play.
 For those players that tend to auto between spell rotations, Annie won't ever be out of Q/W/R range with this change since her current AA range makes it difficult to stick to people as they run away and Annie makes that awkward stop to auto.
But.
 This might only be me.
 I play a lot of Zyra and auto attacking at least once is crucial for her.
 Transitioning from that makes my playing Annie awkward.
They're probably detaining him for too many Ziggs and Corki games in his match history

 Moves and countermoves.
 If it was so easy to shut down TSM'S jungle and mid then they wouldn't win.
 So how do you do such aggressive moves vs TSM without having an equal move happen somewhere on the map?
 You can know the strengths of the team but it doesn't go off a script.
 Bjergson does not really have a history of going on tilt.
 His shotcalling and presence will always be there and again, if they put resources mid TSM is going to adapt, that's what they do.
 You get mid turret, they got bot.
 Things like that.
I hope Fnatic does shit this next season because of this.

That's sorta the point of flash, if you couldn't flash out that would be dumb cause you just flash and get feared from so far away and die anyway.
 Literally negates flash and would be broken
RIP season 2 CLG EU icon.
 It was a glorious couple of weeks.
I totally agree with you.
 90% of reddit are fanboys with no understanding of how the game is played in a professional level.
 ^ ^ ^ ^ See how this post is gonna get downvoted to the ground.
If Rekkles is really going to FNC (which I doubt because of the source) I predict that he'll do bad.
 Players like him and Doublelift who need a lot of attention to carry the game (tbt they can't even do it) are flagged as ''has beenS'' in this meta and the upcoming ones.
 The game has become too dynamic for them, AFK farming is not the thing anymore.
 The ADC needs to deeply understand the macro surrounding the game to do good, the skill comes after.
So Jaedong and his erect penith will be there?
If you dodge to often you get a small time ban from playing.
Early game requires too much grinding in HGSS.
 Generation 1 had so many bugs.
 I haven't played Gen 2 in a while.
 Generation 3 was probably the most balanced in terms of scaling.
 I think.
 I probably need to replay Sinnoh and Unova to be sure about that.
 Gen 3 Kanto had a weird dip in the middle of the story due to opening up lots of paths for you to take, but Hoenn is pretty much going from one place to the next without much room to go out of order.
HGSS had the Physical/Special split.
 I'm not gonna deny that it changed the games, but I don't think it matters as much as some people claim it does (Pokemon is still Pokemon).
 It did, however, had Pokemon following you, which was a great feature.
 I love Johto as well, since Crystal was my first game.
Personally, I really love FireRed.
 It might be due to the fact that I've played the game so many times, because I don't particularly like the lack of diversity of Pokemon in the game.

I need: Cubone Nasus
Tyranitar and Aggron Malphite
Salamence Shyvanna
Krookodile Renekton
Squirtle, jigglypuff rammus
drapion skarner
Rapidash, Deerling, Cobalion Hecarim
Grumpig, Emboar inspired bristle colors of Sejuani
Gothorita, Ursaring Annie
Any bird pokemon for quinn, annivia
farfetched teemo
Flygon Azir
hes not talking out of his ass, new cleaver promotes more less skill ceiling champs to be played, and nerfs further champs like Zed or Talon since they cant sit on brutalizer and get a cleaver when they need it.
 Phage is hella useless and the build path is awkward for every assassin.
Now we will have Gragas/ Sejuani etc (0 skill no brain champs) vs Vi/ Wukong etc which is the same but less tanky and more POINT CLICK cc which makes the game even more annoying to play since not even good reflexes qss save you (hello knockups on every new champ).
I guess Reddit rather have Kassadin midlane than LeBlanc because LeBlanc 'oneshots you' and kassadin does not (see SK vs FNC post-match thread where people cried about Fox oneshotting Steelback with 6 items nashor and 5 drakes).
The thing is this champs take 0 iq to play, 0 decision making and 0 mechanics, every player in the game above gold can get higher ranks just by saying in chat 'pls pick me sej i have all champs' since it gives an advantadge to the team.
He is right, he might not be as polite as le reddit fedoras want, but he is completely right.
And Riot is now buffing Shyvana, Trundle, already buffed Dr.
 Mundo, Ryze and every champ that can use the new cleaver properly (hello Darius + his ult changes) that make no sense whatsoever, 5.
5 was the worst patch that Riot has ever made.
"yay more TANKS" - said no good player ever.
The sad truth is there is no talent

You never had me, you never had your spot on c9!

I wouldn't say that, he is just really meta dependent, when the meta is right he is better then Faker, and when its not he is still top tier.

Keep worse player because we feel bad for him, or get a better player.
Gold 2 but Challenger at heart.
that was true last year but somewhere else on the subreddit smeone posted the graphs of this years rank distribution and theres mre people in goldV than Bronze V now.
This is a repost for the title, I realized I put my channel instead of the actual video (woops)
Haven't seen anyone typing that for months.
 And I don't see how a sarcastic "well played" after an obvious misplay is positive

Top lane smite
In the long run I just think Incarnation is smarter.
 Even if maybe the nerves of finally being unbanned and getting a team tryout might get to him at first, with practice with the team, I'm sure he shines with those mechanics.
tru
Just because you wet your bed when you were little doesn't mean you will always wet our bed unless you still do, then I don't know ;).
 People learn from their mistakes.
 Just because he was for DDoSing does not mean he did or did not.
 Innocent till proven guilty.
I have seen both Yusui and Incarnati0n play and I must say that mechanically Incarnati0n is far better and has a better understanding of macro play as he has had experience in coaching SK Gaming.
 Incarnati0n has the potential to be c9's shotcaller as he is familiar with the strategical plays in the LCS.
While Yusui is young and has been in the challenger scene for a long time, he's really made no impact and his pool is also limited although not as limited as Hai's due to injury which kept him from practicing.
While in EU, Incarnati0n has gone up against many of the top mid laners currently in the LCS and has proven he can compete with them which is an impact in soloQ which Yusui fails to make stand out.
Many of the current LCS players have their toxic moments too such as DoubleLift, Forg1ven, and Piglet, but as they learned and said in their streams that they realized it wasn't worth it to flame your teammates and that there is a difference between constructive criticism and just plain toxic.
Pobelter while hyped hasn't performed well, but it can also be his current team, but he hasn't been able to show up for several splits.
Alex Ich I believe has his skills since he beat Pobelter without prior practice as a sub 3 games in a row.
 Alex Ich while decent also lost to Yusui in a recent challenger event, but I believe that was due to picks and bans.
 In previous years, Alex Ich has also been known to beat Bjersen in 1v1's when Bjergsen still played in EU, but that was a couple years ago and Bjergsen has greatly improved.
 While they are both great players, Yusui is still green mechanically and don't think he has the skills as a shotcaller to fill in Hai's role.
Currently, Bjergsen has no competition aside from XiaoWeiXiao, but XWX doesn't have the team to back him up.
 C9 can still be a revelant contender, but their weakness and strength has been Hai, their mid laner.
 With Yusui, I believe they can be an okay contender, and not sure how he'll do vs Bjergsen, but that route wouldn't make them a World contender, while the gamble with Incarnati0n may or may not break them, but he has the potential to grow greatly.
I agree as well.
 The best part of this change was how her ultimate worked.
 I would have loved if they added a knock-up or slow in the area around where she lands.
 It would add more to her dragon identity.
I feel like Zac is the perfect choice, since there isn't too much opportunity with his design for cool skins, except for maybe pool party Zac which I would buy the shit out of.
Ask /u/bolofoo 
Rekkles of course!
I'd prefer Wickd over Jwaow.
Nah, you're right.
 It wasn't just him, just saying I distinctly remember it.
The Bork rush was mega-bad.
 It makes sense in a tank meta (just for the passive % Current HP+120% attack speed from Q), but that didn't even exist at the time.
Then they changed it from BT/Bork rush on every ADC that isn't Ashe, to IE rush on every ADC regardless, and people realized she pumps out a shit ton of damage with an IE+Q.
If I could get that lee skin and the chroma for 590RP I would.
Respect the pick but don't be a dick.
great idea!
Oh yes, dog poop Malphite.
Championsuggest: na ElCorsair
But they nerf her range on PBE instead of fixing bugs;-;
Not even close, lol, especially when most popular top laners have innate mobility and/or CC.
 Without Flash or Ghost you'll be doing 0 dmg against anyone with any semblance of skill.
My dream of C9 Faker is quickly dying.
 Please don't make it die faster.
Probably because they don't want people being mid-credit card transaction and their game pops.
WT literally only looks good because his team is the best.
 Put him up against and actual competent bot lane and he will get stomped (I'm of the opinion that there isn't a single competent team in NA besides TSM just to clarify).

And again EU gets some shitter as a coach.
 If EU doesn't want to fall even more behind the rest of the world, they have to step up their coaching.

All athletes are people good at some kind of game or the other.
flask and ur passive.
 i play zed so yea.
 u can farm nicely under the tower or shove if you so choose and with flask u have enough sustain.
 perhaps ori and xerath are a bit more extreme but the other ones are pretty easy.
 as long as u are even and don't die early vs them ur lvl 6 can be very devastating especially combined with a gank.
As a student at UNF, it's a positive thing!
Liar.
I'm not a patient person.
I agree that Aatrox could use some love, but Zed does not splitpush as fast as an Aatrox.
 When AA gets both his offensive items, he can shred a turret in around 4-8 seconds depending on if his ult is up.
 Zed needs to have full build to even contend with that speed.
If I have my tiamat and any attack speed on Aatrox, you could die under my tower and I'd still take yours before you can TP back.
I retract all my objections.
But i am blucian
Are people actually taking 1 minute clips of SI and uploading them to their own channel
That's really nice, I'll stick it on my fridge.

"how u butthole feel".
 No comment.
Sona is so OP in aram.
Actually the changes to triforce were before Genja used Triforce on Kog.
Or I might be mistaken, idk, but I'm pretty sure the changes to Triforce (Such as the addition of the Rage passive) was before he first used it on Kog and I believe around that time the cost of Triforce was much lower as well.
Like when Robbie Fowler returned to Liverpool?
 Or when Henry returned to Arsenal?
 Drogba returning to Chelsea?
 Crouch returning to Tottenham?
Rekkles was faced with a situation where three of the players in Fnatic were either planning a move sometime in the near future or retiring.
 He could either:
A) Hope that this new team of rookies is good enough, 
B) Join the best team in Europe, 
I'm pretty sure he made the right choice given the context.
played one game, only remembered people could dash, thought they could be uninterrupted though
I don't want to watch the best players stomp the second best players again.
 Sorry, but nobody makes sports movies where the best destroy their league and win the championship with no effort.
 Sorry if your comment was sarcastic, can't tell over text.
But he is half Korean.
I think he made a few PR snafu's on his social media, and several pro players have spoken about his (age appropriate) immaturity.
 I believe that coupled with the whole community being irrational about him leaving his "family Fnatic" has caused his decline in public opinion 
I know right?
 this guy is a [](/heimerdinger)
Worked in my first games of testing it.
 Even tested it on leblanc+teemo worked fine http://euw.

Why does lucians passive have to go away while she gets to sit on hers?
 It's dumb.
 Every champ with a similar passive gets to sit on theres BUT lucian.
Nappy time for this little guy
A white one for Zac for.
 research
Do you like it?
 If you do like it then don't worry- just enjoy!
Reminds me of a over edited version of kshaway.
 But you wont backstab us and become the illuminati >3 subbed
Maybe even instead of having your team on top and the enemy on the bottom, having it in columns so the lane matchups are together so it's quicker to locate which lane you're looking for.
This thread is full of suggestions and butt-kissing, but nobody is mentioning what we were all saying awhile back.
 Although Riot has this stance of "don't buy it if you don't want it", a lot of us think that it is cheap and sleezy of Riot to even consider charging for chromas being that they take absolutely no skill to make and can be made in mere minutes.
 By anyone.
 There was one big thread where a guy showed us that they can literally be made in minutes.
 He made a dozen or so upon request in no time.
 And you know what?
 Some looked amazing and much better than official chromas.
I don't see why more people aren't mentioning this.
I think the interrupt is a necessity.
 The spell delay might be a bit much, that basically makes the ability a kamikaze move.
.

I'm still rocking that SHC flair.
They already did this with nurse Akali for Red Cross IIRC
Just a warning riven is 100% skill based, so might take a while to really be able to play her.
 Gl though!
Unstoppable Force!
They already have something for mastery.
 I am all for this if Riot does make money off them, it is a way to repay a company that has treated it's customers so well.
 I seriously bet they make a ton of money off this simply because kids will love them and they are pretty cheap compared to regular skins.
 I think they'd sell a lot more if they split the price to way low and just sold them in singles, since then anyone can just throw their extra money at them.
campionsuggest: na Jeraiathan
You're salty because i said whoosh xD thinks for wasting time out of your day on me
Yeah the damage doesn't make sense, make the damage small so it draws aggro and makes sniping with it more meaningful (imagine landing the level 18 50 true damage snipe with mark, that would be cool) but isn't just good for dps.
How the fuck is RP pricing remotely greedy?
 It's fucking standard behaviour for universally all games that have paid for currency and a pretty standard practice in the real world as well ($10 gift cards instead of $6.
85 cents).
 I have played tons of MMOs over the year (not the same genre but still have microtransactions) and Riot is by far the best company that has handled microtransactions.
The packs costs less than two slices of pizza or a single sub from subway.
 I eat out at least once a week and get maybe 10 minutes worth of satisfaction each time.
$5 for three recolour options that I'm going to spend dozens of hours using is a solid deal.
Why the fuck are there so many people on this sub who make a big deal over $5 or so dollars?
 It can't be because it's full of teens or whatever either, when I was in high school I still had enough money to buy a sub from subway.
Well done but I am guessing 'you' could play her mid to the same success.
>Her damage is insane for support.
That's because she isn't a support
There's just much more counter play against him than there was before.
 Thus, not making him as good with the removal of his silence.
Personally, I think he's still good especially since there are Talon mains in challenger (1-2).
 However, he's not fit for competitive AFIK, especially with the mana issues and alternative being Zed.
I know he was being cheeky.
 And I don't really see how it's politics.
 It's social science.
 I still wouldn't mind hearing your counter-arguments.
I still think the most epic one was when he said Ezreal was useless not realizing just how much play he was getting in Korea and then bam Blue Ezreal FOtM for ages and was dumps terming people left and right.

Greenland is an autonomous country within Denmark.

Why does everyone keep forgetting how Hai destroyed Bjergsen in Spring playoffs solokilling him and not dying once in the series.
 That was Hai in his prime and unfortunately his lung collapsed soon after.
 Hai didn't just perform against "bad" NA mids.
well imagine late game.
 with and IE PD and SHIV.
 you'll just constantly having bonus gold.
 pretty small advantage turning into a huge one if ya farm.
I would only ever buy it if it wasn't temporary.
Edit: Furthermore, people are suggesting an "LCS team skin slot" idea where you can change it to whatever LCS teams are in at the beginning of each split.
 I personally don't like this, either.
 If I buy a skin for a shitter team that doesn't last, it's still the team I chose to support.
 I should be able to keep it even if it is a relic once they get relegated and disband.
i think he doesn't want to admit koreans are better, not Korea as a region, which can be true.
It can also be black cleaver with the new update, but i get what you're saying.
 What about as a 5th or 6th item?
championsuggest: oce Threepwood
He's an alright player, and he could in the future be a really good ADC.
 The problem is, Fnatic doesn't need an alright ADC they need a good one.
It's probably a Keith vs Piglet situation.
 Xpecial has to micromanage Keith whereas Piglet already knows what to do.
Whether by a creep or by a tower, WINNING'S WINNING.
The laws of physics don't change every couple of months.
You're looking at it the wrong way here.
 Tom Brady's passing range is defined by physics, but a computer program doesn't have to abide by physics, it runs based on what the programmers decide.
 So those patches are attempts to tweak what they programmed/fix errors, much like the NFL, for example, will change rules to protect the fairness/safety/etc.
 of the game.
Very few people will argue that eSports are the same as "regular sports," by the way.
 The professional gamers that people look up to in the eSports world are the same as the athletes that you make look up to.
 They're people who have put countless hours into something that they love and have reached the pinnacle of skill for their time.

From what I can tell, it seems to me like you're thinking of the sort of classic video games that you turn on for a couple hours and you beat a level and then you come back and beat a couple more levels later until you eventually complete the game.
 Which I can understand why it'd be weird for players or teams to be given so much attention.
What you have to understand is that these games are very different from that.
 Each time you log on, you play on a team of players against another team in a self-contained game that usually lasts 30-40 minutes with clearly defined winners and losers.
 There aren't levels to beat or points to earn that will carry over to the next game, you just start a new game against a new set of opponents from the beginning, just like football or chess.
As the game became popular, sponsored tournaments for the best teams got more and more attention.
 A little more than a year ago, the company that develops and runs the game, Riot, decided to take the most successful teams from each region and create leagues that participate in weekly, live games with each other much like any other sports league out there, which is why you see threads about the games appear on reddit with such regularity.

Wow quality post 10/10.
 Please refer to /r/shitposts for more exiting content like this.
You aren't understanding what I'm saying.
 Yeah, there are some Western players that can compete.
 But the sheer depth of talent that has come out of Korea is absurd.
 It's why the top team in every major region has at least one Korean despite the fact that China is the only region actually importing elite Koreans.
 Hell, Huni was a nobody in Korea and he's the best top laner in EU right now.
I like this bug.
 Fuck Morgana.
Wukong Lucian.
 As normal, the implication being that black people are monkeys.
If there was such a thing as a bandwagon pro, Rekkles would be it.

They just aren't gonna take away someone's ability to type any messages at all, some things can't be communicated with pings, its never going to happen.

You were technically AFK.
 Its no ones fault buy your own.
If it was easy to work around the system would not punish AFKs nearly as well.
Hallo
Pobelter isn't great but he's going to be better than Challenger players for the most part.
 Also, I highly doubt they'd be able to get incarnation.
Incarnation will likely not settle for anything less than a team that can go to worlds or actually contend against strong teams.
 Unless of course you threw a lot of money at him, but he seems like a very driven and prideful person, much like Forgiven.
As Incarnation is currently pretty high profile, I'd say he's getting more offers and tryouts that are better than him joining a sub par team.
I'm not sure about Yusui since I haven't seen a lot of him, but from what I understand recently, people are saying he's not that good and getting carried.
It's post match discussion reddit threads so you always need to be careful taking that with face value, but still.
 I've heard very mixed opinions and Pobelter at least is solid mechanically, with a lot of LCS experience.
It's hard to say if Pobelter or Altec was the problem on the team, considering the very poor management and strange team decisions like Altec support, their Coach ADC.
 etc.
Why, support isn't even the longest position to wait for.
 Jungle is.
Another reddit supported idea to get stuff for free.
i never said that i think yusui is a better choice.
 in fact, i believe that incarnati0n will be better suited for C9.
English talking bot lane that would be really good (smoothie and altec have both shown to be very good) and korean speaking mid jng and top (if they get pobeltor).
 If they actually make this roster it could be quite scary.
Morgana top :D
or when you're forced to play zed supp in solo q because you had a guy say he's going double mid even though you're first pick.
 Man, i was laughing every time i got a kill that game, good times
That is probably a good idea, but it's probably better to go to the internet for more things like special interactions and the like.
Her recall animation is undeniably Sailor Moon.
I dont follow many league personalities outside of C9 and TSM.
 A link would be apreciated though to a tweet
Praise memes max
Okay dude whatever.
 Just remember, there are tonnes of teams that have done this.
 H2K, Fnatic come to mind.
 You have to start somewhere and you have to take chances.
 Even if there's a chance to fail, you can say you tried.
 You just didn't sit around too scared to fail and claim CLG can never get better than this without even trying something different.
 But clearly, if its not 100% guaranteed its not worth it, right?
 I hope HSGG doesn't have your mindset.
But there are more to comms than just when action is happening.
 You have to consider the information they should be sharing about their lane when action isn't really going on.
 I'm not an expert by any means, but to assume that the only comms that go on or that all of their comms are like the ones in the highlight reels is just an overly presumptuous statement in my opinion.
 I'm sure their communication issues stem deeper than that, but honestly there is no way to know for sure without having access to them in full.
Thats not the point.
 My point is tht you dont have to buy the skin.
 At this point, you should know what you're getting, whether it be $5 skin that you pay $20 for or anything.
I am in.
I know Riot wants Money.
I understand People were asking for them.
But come on, they are perfect for Champion Mastery!
I don't think it really matters.
 Steelback does what Fnatic needs him to do.
 He's there when they need him.
No I hope not, yusui is a very raw player, kind of like how bjergsen was before lcs.
 he needs to get into an org that actually knows how to develop talent, which I think c9 does.
 His skill ceiling however is very large.
Oh look someone got on their alt acct.
 LMAO what a sad europoor.
 Stay salty and mad chump.
I'd like the ward skins to be the regular price and let us keep them indefinitely.
 If a team gets relegated, give the players an option to "trade out" for a new ward skin or keep the old one for nostalgia.
No offense, but there isn't much except for two random people on reddit saying they have info.
 Can you point to something you've said historically that shows you have more knowledge than the average person on the subject?
When they aren't invisible that is.
When you say "vote with your wallet" what you're telling me is "stop playng and resub to WoW"?
 Ok got it!
this is where riot gets their lore from
Yeah, they were banned.
 Nothing to do with skill.
Ah, the good old, "I'm not a racist but.

yeah, too lazy to find the exact numbers but with 55+ armor at lvl 1 she can't really kill anyone till lvl 6.
get rid of that Aram account will yah ;)
Yeah.
 NA talks like they created Bjergsen and it's their own player and how they're so much better than EU.
There has not been a truer statement than

I personally love Garen.
 He's so much fun to play.
 I don't think he's the strongest champion to play top lane, but he can be a valuable part of the team and people shouldn't hate on you for playing him.
Not really the best idea tbh
what is it?
seems like euw is down.
 got a disconnect and couldnt rejoin.
just watched my history and seems like the game was never played , actually good since we were about to lose it.
A big scary yeti skin for Nunu!
 It would work perfectly because Nepal/Mt.
 Everest is notorious for its stories of a yeti terrorizing the civilians.
Might be an option if it reaches late game but would pref warmogs (since you probably have thornmail) even glory wuld be good on darius he can initiate , but when you start lane make sure you rush that damage item since his damage is what most if not all champions cant deal with in laning phase :)
I still want Arcade Yorick, with Ghouls 'n Goblins references.
And Arcade Mundo with Pacman for his Ws.
Stop distracting people from the Arcade skins I want :D
I remember seeing an interview recently and it seemed Rekkles went out of his way to put down steeelback's play when rating top ADCs.

 I've even died a couple of times due to this.
I used to be a darius main want my advice on darius ?
 Dont play him.
 He fades out soo much late game , easily kited by carries and not so much 1 v 1 potential against fighters like irelia or even a stacked nasus he is good in bronze/silver since you will rek your lane's mom amd either he will afk or the teams moral will die.
 So yeah.
What if I want the ward skin of my first team.
 I still wear the clothes for my favourite no longer extant F1 team.
To further this point, how long have you guys been typing on a computer and how many of you have seen huge improvements in your typing speed in the last year?
 I don't think I'd ever be able to reach 150+ wpm even though I "practice" every day.
 I know typing speed doesn't matter that much in League, but I'm just trying to get my point across that there can be talent involved when controlling a mouse and keyboard.
I actually don't really get the hype around Kiwikid for this series.
 If anything the series showed me that Trance is a really weak support.

Are there other interactions like this?
 Most special interactions I know involve lines between champions who are related by lore.
 I've never seen anything like this!
On darius to be useful you need 1 damage item and then full tank and the damage item will either br triforce or hydra mallrt just doesnt deliver
i mean its pretty early until next split starts so this means most likely jsut a tryout and not a confirmed change

Why would I would waste my stun and abilities if I know you can all-in me?
 I play Annie, I'm not going to waste that stun on a minion when my laning opponent is in range of an all-in or I'm open to an easy gank.
 That relies on the Annie being bad, not on the actions of whoever's playing against her.

 soaz was a carry?
I don't think so, but okay.
You said he always had shields on him, insinuating there was more than one shield, which there was not.
You also said the team was built around him, it wasn't a juggeradc comp.
 It was a standard team comp with the only thing fundamentally used to make the adc stronger at all being Lulu.
Those aren't things that either of us "saw" those are just literal truths.
 He had A shield and he performed exceptionally well in a fairly standard team comp against double thornmail.
 Now if it was something we "saw" and you're saying his team played to support him and make him carry then doesn't that just speak to the power of the role?
 That they would play around making him carry, you don't do that for a weak ass role.
Well element's is going to challanger series.
Am I mistake or does this Cassiopeia skin sale break the record for longest time it has taken for a skin to be on sale since release.
 Pretty sure Desperada Cass has never been on sale since Cass was released in 2010.
tldr downvoted
I believe she has the best attack speed at level 18 too, But when you look at other hypercarries like kog'maw and jinx, They have 700-800 attack range thus ensuring safety in teamfights.
 Ashe however only has 600 with no mobility either so Ashe might be able to do tons of damage but lets see on the release if she will be able to be on par with those hyper carries/late game champions.

Sort of, but it's attached to the minion skin file so it would inevitably wrap around the model that they replace the minions with in the future.
 Just getting it prepped it seems like.
I have told my friend this so many times.
 They should get rights to things for legit skins.
 They could flat out pay or give a portion of each purchase.

 He played for UoL in the promotion series before being replaced by Kikis , and subbed for SK at worlds while Sven was suspended.

The Steam users succeeded at reversing their situation by constantly bringing up the issue that they not only had to pay for what used to be free (mods), but that those mods were low quality and encouraged low quality work since it paid off for the creator.
 Steam quickly backtracked and removed that and issued refunds.
We can vote with our wallets too.
 If you want a chroma pack you can just add it yourself for free by modding.
 I don't see chromas being worth paying for, compared to quality skins.
Haha I remember Peter saying how comfortable they were on stream but he wasn't getting anything out of it, few days later, partnership.

 demonblade tryndamere is one of the most dated legendary skins this game has
That was there last patch.
i also said the same thing earlier, its the best way, more people will buy the original skin which costs more than the chromos
*This is all about Annie support*
While I agree this range nerf is pretty fucking massive, it won't kill her as much as Zyra is right now.
 575 is still pretty decent and will give you range over nearly everyone except a handful of ADCs.
Unless I'm missing something the range nerf is the only thing she got and she only got it her for AAs instead of spells.
 Her AA trading in lane was unmatched, so it seems necessary.
I wouldn't be surprised to see a switch to Mpen reds to have a weaker laning phase but get a stronger mid-late game scaling.
Not bad.

Yeah, I conducted a very expensive study with the help of some of the greatest minds in human history still alive today to be able to make that comment.
Of course I fucking don't, is just what I've personally seen in social media like twitter, facebook, youtube and all that crap (which heavily relies on who and what I follow).
 Sorry for not submitting my comments to peer review.
Kogmaw is still the best in a juggermaw comp but lucian is probably the safest pick atm.
 Jinx nerfs didn't really hurt her much, just means you cant ult the tanks right on top of you for huge damage.

 You can tell who they are too because they'll start dorans ring and be useless for the entire first 20 mins (laning phase) as she stands in the bush or autos the enemy support while sniping cs.
 When she isn't doing that, she'll be rolling over dying in her free time, giving free kills to the enemy adc because she thinks its a solo lane and she can kill 1v2.
 Then when she is 0/8/2 or something she'll afk because 'omg noob team can't carry' with her only item completed in the 20 minutes being sorc boots (because no gold income).
Yeah it's crazy when I finish IE and get off one auto attack just for poke before hitting a minion for cs.

then the auto lands and half their health melts and I'm just like o.

Here's one of our games.
I see a lot of Football posts reach the front page talking about specific players - how maybe one is leaving the sports, or how one is joining a specific team (I'm not sure what the Seattle Seahawks are, I assume it's a certain group within the NFL).
 My question is - why are those specific players so popular?
 It's like they are celebrities among you guys.
 Is it because they have a lot of achievements or experience, or gameplay time?
 I'm just trying to figure it out because when you talk about certain players like you would talk about a movie star, it piques my curiosity.
Why are they so popular, and don't you have the ability to be just as good a player yourself, most of the US even has the chance to learn Football in school, don't you?
 Thanks for your responses!
>at worst
 I'm pretty sure calling something backwards or stupid is a diss.
lol
I don't really agree.
 They can make use of the extra health in the same way anyone else would, and the other stats are really solid on certain ADs.
 I don't think just because you are in the back line means you won't be taking damage.
 Having extra health means you could play differently; you dont have to play exactly the sane as you would with a squishier build.
 You would only build this later in the game anyway, which means that teams are going to be trying to kill you at that point anyway.

This isn't very realistic because after a split or two, everyone who's going to buy an "LCS rotating ward" or whatever, has done so.
 At that point, it's basically riot putting work into cosmetics that will generate extremely minimal profit since there aren't many new buyers.
Plus they can't even stop because people have paid for these wards forever or whatever.
Here, have a have.
Of course I'll take that of off of you too.

 Can't they see Rekkles only makes things worse?

 Even if Steelback wasn't that great, rekkles is even worse.
 Please don't!
Exactly.
 Of course people are going to buy whats new.
 He pretty much just said, "buy it if you like it, don't if you hate it.
" Which is true, but that's far from the point.
Now lets just hope they will still have incentive to make new skins instead of picking champions to recolor over the next year.
 I wouldn't be surprised if these recolors were already made when they first made the champions/skins.
 Definitely a good business tactic.
The champion everyone was crying about previous season.
You mean Traditional Lucian?

Yeah this is the one thing keeping me from investing in the Lucian chromas currently.
 I only want one of them.
Each of the Chroma sets have names, so this one is Lucian Prime - Blue, Red, Yellow.
The Nemesis Jax one is called "Nemesis Jax Sand - Cream, Brick, Amber"
lol.
Imagine a team with Meteos, Sneaky and Incarnation.
 Holy shit that would be a stacked team if Incarnation can carry hard like some say.
 Also, it could have a positive effect on Balls playing.
like he was previously and him begin carrying harder again.
Being on the winning team is currently a 50% winrate.
 Rito plz buff.
the lack of champion release is alarming for me.
.
>~~The~~ **This** community has overwhelmingly said that they would rather not pay RP for them.
 So idk what you guys are expecting
It's not free though.
 If you're buying chromas with IP, you're not spending IP on champions.
 So if you want champions, you need to spend RP.
It's an additional IP sink next to Runes.
Oh wow, how original, please tell us where the technology is then?
I became a fan of WE too.
 I followed them a bit after IEM to see if it was a fluke that they beat GET or if they were actually good.
 After IEM, WE actually had a pretty good record in lpl.
 I think they had the 2nd or 3rd best W/L from coming back from IEM to playoffs.
I also really want to see SKT at MSI.
 The midlaner showdowns at that event would be sick.
maybe.
 maybe not.
 soaz could have changed in the meantime.
 also ducky apparently helped them with CWA which maybe was not needed anyway but according to the post he did is job right and at least they bind it to the success of his coaching.
 i mean even if everything wents downhill they can still replace him without bad blood.
This isnt a nerf for support annie.
 Support Annie has well been taken care of, since she requires quite a lot of coordination between your team to take full advantage of.
 Its harder to react to a flash tibbers in soloqueue than it is to thresh landing a hook.
 This is a nerf to mid annie, which has recently been tearing up lower and mid elo.
 Annie is in this awkward middle ground where they cant buff her base value and nerf her scaling because then support annie becomes better.
 And the other option they chose was to buff her scaling and nerf her base values, which made mid annie stronger.
 Which is why they are trying new stuff now, like changing the AA.
tbh most teams have Koreans anyway, Koreans will win no matter what, unless ahq put out a TPA there
Plot twist:
Bjerg is intentionally losing to Yusei so that C9 will be relegated and TSM will reign 5ever.
"dominate NA"
Doesn't matter
The difference between the second best midlaner and the third best midlaner is great than the distance between challenger and bronze.
Hey Gweedo, you guys are hilarious.
 I love the little bits you guys do.
 Keep it up!
I'm afraid your opinions are too angsty and entitled.
 Please tone it down and understand that Riot is working in your best interests.
But that dsnt have to be the case, if he played 15 of those game thrue lat to d5, then picked up all other champs, and won all those 15 games of vlad in plat, he just need to win 6 out of the remaining 11 matches to have 80% winrate on vlad, in master.
Or are all 26 matches from the league master?
Yea I meant non ult.
 A champ like maokai can take on average ~11% of your health every ~11 seconds before adding AP and CDR and its also a invulnerable rooting gapcloser.
 That kind of difference in Garen's kit get people all hot and bothered all the time and I completely understand.
championsuggest: na Toxicpipluppz
It's the Brits!
 SHC/MYM loses both Impaler and Kasing and get auto-relegated.
 KaSing goes to H2K and they go on a tear.
 Impaler, unfortunately got involved with the trash organization that is Coast.
 He was doomed before he had a chance.
That would actually be a pretty cool plot twist.
Look at his zed, syndra, and annie though.
Well to be fair, Plano is pretty close to Allen, TX.
I've heard that other mobas are doing champion mastery recolor/skin for free stuff.
 So that's where that comes from mostly.
The problem I have with it is that they're bundled in threes when you're probably only ever going to want to use one.
 Like Leesin's ones are all cool, but I'd still probably only use the one I like the most.
Most people are probably going to only want one of them as well.
None, to be honest lol.
When your the face of a business in a certain region,your gonna have to use that kinda of tongue in cheek talk.
You see it all the time in company pr talk.
I doubt its anything more than pricing/currency
elements would still lose if they get faker.
 its a team issue not player issue.
 if it would be a player issue all those roster swaps had way more impact and i am pretty sure krepo had some impact because he changed some support stuff doings like watching more replays and actually discussing stuff
I still find it insane how him and a few others (NiP/LD) wasted so much time after NiP lost promos.
 I feel like EU is way more stacked than NA as far as talent goes.
 People just getting lost in between splits in EU where as in NA, for the most part, if you belong in the LCS, you pretty much are already in it.
Hurricane Katarina
calling it "obscene" is quite the overstatement, try not to use such charged language 
the speed of aa reset is the problem, back when they removed his silence they made the animation more fluent, now it's even worse than before that
if you're talking about casters they can't be biased similar to articles that aren't taking anyone's sides.
 If you noticed Jatt's interview he literally stated that c9 was at their ceiling cap with hai and needed to replace him in order to contend internationally but he never said that as a caster.
tl;dr articles and casters from riot are suppose to be neutral and just point out the team strengths and weaknesses as non judgmental as possible not just say they suck.
Didn't know that.
 Thank you for the clarification!
Iunno, Shockblade Zed is good enough for me.
 SKT Zed is good for the price, and the default skin isn't lacking, what's the big issue.
you definitely should be a bit more detailed in your post lol
It was no secret him and xpecial didnt get along.
 They were colleagues and not friends.
 Also him and OddOne just never really interracted alone.
 Regi was Chaox's close friend and Dyrus was his best friend, but Chaox and Regi kept getting in disputes which put strain on them from time to time, as well as Chaox underperforming and steadily getting worse.
 Regi did what they had to do, and a mixture of the strain on their relationship, chaox being hurt from regi benching him, neither one of them wanting to particularly come forward to the other and how close they once were just made for one of those situations that people tend to stop talking all together.
There is probably no 'bad blood' now.
 They more than likley dont talk now through having very little to talk about as well as no reason to start talking again.
 Chaox was hurt, Regi was also hurt, both just pushed passed it the way they deal with things and I guess never looked back.
Its a shame because if Chaox didnt take a break after getting benched hed have gotten on another team no bother (because Xpecial made him look amazing, and any team woulda picked him up) and hed have gotten more of a chance to work on his performance.
 Instead he took the break, and lost all chance for competative experience, and decided tocome back to the competative scene after so long, fell behind on meta shifts, and became 'rusty' so to speak, and now ks pretty much doomed to challanger series of whatever region he is in.
 In the event he qualifies.
 The TDK situation will happen to him.
 Every region has much better ADC's now and hes past his prime.
 Hes a really nice dude though (met him at LCS london).
 Just a bad decision after getting benched - but still a totally understandable one.
has rekless or fnatic released any statements on social media?
Terrible terrible logic.
 League of Legends is actually a lot more grindy then other mobas.
 Rune pages, the rate at which you get champions, and so on is actually a lot slower here then many other games.
Queen of hearts Ahri!
I don't know how many people play aram, but it's my favorite game mode because it requires the least energy investment.
 After a hard day of work, and with time limited, the last thing I want to do is spend 30 minutes trying to get into a stressful ranked game.
I know I should be thankful for riot doing anything with it at all (considering dominion and TT barely get anything), but I wish they'd invest more energy in balancing out the lows in the game mode besides easy patchwork fixes.
ARAM has some good potential to become a classic game mode, but it needs some actual love from up above in the company.
Right now, bruisers > everything.
 And that's because mark has a 20 (15*) second cooldown, and adds to their burst.
Lol there's no way bjerg is better than we1less
i think if na wants to breed talented players, they have to start at the root of the game itself: solo queue.
 na solo queue is notorious for being trolly and less serious than it's counterparts in the east, so if the competitiveness of solo queue increases there are more chances for aspiring players to improve quickly.
past solo queue, the challenger scene needs a lot more resources devoted to it.
 upcoming challenger players should be able to play in conditions similar to the standard of lcs teams.
 more job stability and infrastructure or organization is needed for players and teams.
 there is a lack of incentive to play in challenger because people have to delay or put aside real life goals or obligations just for the chance to go pro, and if they fail, they usually end up falling flat.
 it's really all or nothing in competitive gaming as we have seen multiple times with many retired players.
i think NA orgs just think that they don't have time anymore.
 there is clearly desperation in NA LCS teams and orgs to try to catch up to the east as quickly as possible and to close that gap.
 a lot of lcs teams have brought in analysts, coaches, more head count for management, even sports psychologists to be as professional and efficient as possible, which is all good for the overall growth of NA.
 but more than that, they want good players.
 Orgs are probably thinking "shit, korea and china and eu are so good, we need to catch up to them otherwise NA will always be considered trash and we'll stagnate forever.
 we can't waste time hoping that a less known NA player with no competitive experience or no big stage matches against better players will outperform these foreign imports, who have the experience in more competitive leagues against talented players".
 it's just not feasible for teams to waste time trying to breed a homegrown player with no competitive experience or less raw talent than an import.
 while there are a lot of prospective players in NA, imports just seem to offer more on paper.
 that's all the majority of orgs care about when they decide on players.
as for huhi, i'll concede to your point, huhi being korean does matter a lot.
 when weighing a korean solo q player to an NA solo q player, automatically a lot of people will pick the korean because while he might not have competitive experience or has never proven himself in a competitive league, team fusion probably thought that because huhi is always practicing in a region crowded with more talented and skilled players in a more serious solo q environment, he probably offered more skill and the right mentality to improve and win than an NA solo q player.
never buying a chroma pack.
And then you'll hear everyone cry about how it's not fair that just because they love a roll that isn't support that they are "punished".
You may have a good idea about additional benefits for high demand roles but 2x IP is WAY too much.
I don't know if "easily", Amazing played pretty well from second half of the split to playoffs.
 I agree that Meteos was the best overall, but not by far.
I love sports, but I also love eSports.
 These guys are basically the same as pro sportsmen that people love.
I remember putting in a pretty lengthy and, I thought, fairly reasonable piece of feedback when I got this survey.
 I don't think I'll be spending my time doing surveys anymore, as all the PBE feedback, bug reports, and surveys seem to have almost no impact on how they decide to make changes.
 I understand that I'm only a drop of water in an ocean of players, but this is far from the last time players at large will have their voices go unrecognized.
 It's mostly the DOCUMENTED bugs that make it to live that really push me over the edge to say something like this.
 But this is just another event of the same type of shit.
>split 1-1 vs TSM
Ya know, the only other team at Worlds that managed to take even a game off of SSW.
 And before you say it, SSW picked just as stupid a team comp in their game 3 against SSB as they did against SHRC and TSM, but SSB just wasn't good enough to beat them even with that advantage.

Yeah!

 Clg is doing ok!
 At least no relegation this year!
!
 It's ok to be mediocre .
 HyperX
Nocturne mid has been a thing for a long time.
 I think it started as a TF counter in S3, because if you timed it right you could follow Destiny with your ult or something.
 Dunno.
 Lot of pros tried it, they sucked with it, it lost a couple competitive matches, it fell off the planet.
It's got decent wave clear and excellent roaming.
 Strong mid game.
 Falls off late game.
It's not about whether or not you have the money to buy them, it's about disagreeing with how they are going about selling them.
 I really want the yellow Lee Sin skin as it goes very well with the Bruce Lee theme, but those other 2 skins in that pack are useless to me and I have no desire to use either of them.
 Many others feel the same way.
What is the problem?
 Because some people actually like this idea Riot put out?
 Crazy how people have different opinions on things and some people like the colors.
 People WILL buy anything Riot releases you're right because there's always going to be someone who's favorite champion gets a skin or a skin someone just LIKES that they release and they will buy it.
 The same goes for these chromas.
 People like them.
 People will buy them.
OH.
 DUH!
 I did see a lot of hype about the updated Cleaver and forgot what it actually did!
 Haha!
 Riot beat me to the punch on this one haha!
Sure that's your side of the story.
 Either way you're getting reported way more than 90% of people so shit happens.

Welcome to being a vocal minority.
 What exactly did you "trust" that they would do about this?
 What was wrong in the first place?
 Your comment seems driven by anger with little clear direction.
Coming from a guy whose team has 2 KR players on it.
 Don't throw stones in a glass house.
Pretty sure account name is "Hot Guy Drop Hack"
amumu and nasus aren't soloq gods lol
lol, did you forget when Froggen took a shit on Pepi and made him rage in LCS?
I honestly can't understand how this isn't the same as an iphone 3 user complaining about how apple should update the iphone 3 to be as snappy as the new model.
 You bought the old product.
 The way this business works is you're either going to use a product that looks slowly more and more out of date or you're going to get another.
(Unless I'm missing something in which case, someone enlighten me?
)
Well, since most of the populus is crippled from high ping and packet loss.
Whatever team comes in first place should have their ward skin kept in store for a few weeks after the split while every other one is taken out, and the ward skin itself shouldn't be removed, because they won the split.
Secondary idea would be the top idea but instead of everyone else losing ward skins they bought for teams that didnt come in first the ward skins everyone bought would all turn into the winning teams ward skin, to use or not to use.
Lets keep it to Rampart
Earthshaker Rammus.
 The anti-charity skin.
**edit:** wtf, it's not that funny but thanks.
They need chroma packs for champs I actually care about: Ori, Soraka, lulu, etc.
Am I the only one that noticed the weird big red elixir looking item?
 This can't be from this current patch with that can it?
 Plus the mura had a weird not updated texture.
 .

Same, except I'm silver 5 :v
wait i thought we are the EL coaches did we change sides?
If enough people wise up and start forming their OWN teams (a la cloud 9) instead of joining organizations that will replace them then they WILL make it.
 But really Rito should step in here.

I mean, I think this is just a small reason as to why the LoL client is really just bad.
 It's been 5 years and there are still tons of features it lacks and problems it has.
 Like if you go back and forth between the shop and your rune pages/masteries a lot, the client starts to freeze.
 :O
Half the purpose of the skin is for others to see them.
Obviously that means those people really are OK with buying them, otherwise they wouldn't have.
But they're from EU.
 I know that EU players hate NA and CN players that play on their servers, as well as Russian players, because they're overly toxic.
Zeke's herald with triforce if you have an ad heavy team that can benefit from aura.
Gimp is free, y'know.
he likes grils
championsuggest: NA Bunny Teemo
A least 6 figures, but it's probably closer to 1 mil.
He didn't even reply to my question :.
|
Mastery System beta was from the start meant to be for one server, we got lucky on that one (more exciting on paper than in practice though).
 Chroma Packs were never meant to be restricted to x servers, and we weren't given a valid reason for the delay.
 More so, they announced it on the day other servers were getting it, instead of saying so in the Chroma Pack announcement.
No it isn't.
 chat restriction still allows them to communicate their angst.
 It also doesnt stop someone from getting reported again obviously for constant disruption when they CAN chat.
So no it is not the same.
 And you don't get to self-impose it.
You can't use it as parental control.
 You can't do it on yourself.
 Don't downvote a good idea, just because you mistakenly think it exists already.
can't wait!
I am glad my life isn't so pathetic that I have to justify myself by arguing with random strangers on reddit.
I think that the whole backlash would be easily solved if you made it possible to just buy one.
 If people like it, they will buy more of them by time.
 This way it would be win/ win for both you guys at Riot and for us players.
 There are far too many people who are basically uninformed about the ideas of mastery etc.
 to oppose people who are more considerable to make it not worth for you Riot to not have them for money.
THAT SHACO SKIN THOUGH
candypanda back to SK would be a massive step downwards.
 your scenario with CW is far more plausible
TBH if they made the skin cost x amount of IP I would buy it.
 But I agree that I would never use RP on content that will dissapear.
>up the price on the 3 pack to 650
well doesn't that screw over the people planning on buying the 3 packs?
That worked well for Alliance.
Aniva!
I was thinking if it was possible to normalize/raise mmr by doing this since you don't lose mmr.
Yasuo is probably one of the best ones.
wait what does this mean by ring?
 like her w, or more like veigar's event horizon?
 sorry, i just don't understand what they mean by this.
Well, if your team failed 4 consecutive splits, you should know by now its not just a fault of one player.
 Why don't you kick all the team members, including Doublelift?
Most probably he removed it himself because every single upvoted comment was not agreeing with OP.
 It didn't have any content either way, it was just the title with a "\^" for text.

I only want one of lee sins chromas.
 :/ The lucian ones are too ugly to charge money for.
 Fact
No it was already like this in the start of season 5.
note that this is reddit, a website popular among the west.
 perhaps on eastern media/league, Deft and PawN are much more popular.
 Ask any korean/chinese casual maybe theyve heard of those more than bjerg.
No, actually, he's not implying that at all.
It doesn't take more than 5s for a transaction, I can't see them getting messed up too often
Ferguson Lucion should come with Chroma too:
* Baltimore Lucian + 2 more impending riots in other cities.
Esports and Sports are two seperate things, and I hate sports, and I love Esports, but thats just a fact.
 If you look up "Sports" in the dictionary it says "an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.
"
This isnt Esports.
 That being said, Esports is WAY better imo and will last a long time :D
What.
 the fuck.
 Did you do to Jinx.
Hey You Pikachu master race
And you know that because thorugh your redditor crystal ball I presume ?
Theres reason to believe he is good yeah, but soloq doesnt show much in terms of competative play (chaox is good example.
 High level challanger ADC, couldnt get a team last split because he jsnt that gokd any more.
 Still csnt get into any ladder after failing to qualify).
Coaching doesnt equate to on the rift skills, Monte coached, and is only silver IIRC, but I do admit that does bridge the gap a bit.
 But not completley.
I have faith In him but I'm not buying into the hype before I see anything, and im not going to discredit him either.
 All hes shown so far since he has returned is that he can tear up soloq.
 So can PoB.
 Hasnt done him much good so far.
 He needs experience in competstive during the current meta, hell need to mesh with the team both personality wise and gameplay wise and about a million other qualities.
 I hope he does well, I really dont want the other guy (spelling of name kills me) to be on C9, not because I dislike him.
 But because he is talented and I like the C9t roster - and want my boi sheep back in the LCS.
 But I would take both sides of the "HES AMAZING" and the "HES OVERHYPED" arument with lots of salt.
 They have nothing to base either on other than soloq
Have you ever played Magic The Gathering?
 50% of the game is about esthetics and the other 50% is about strategy/deck building.
No one **needs** foils, but that does not mean I do not want foils/unhinged cards.
 They look dope as shit, and I want my cards to look dope as shit while I feed you the doo-doo.
If you do not think it is worth it then do not buy it.
 You do not need to make a post about an optional thing that Riot did.
Are you going to stand in front of McDonalds and spout off about how their new sandwich taste bad and people should not waste their money?
 No; people will buy it if they like it, and will not if they do not.
 It just makes you a self centered ass for thinking your opinion should be the only opinion.
People are downvoting you (and this is my guess) because people keep calling Riot money grubbers who do not care about the community.
 They are doing what they believe is best and trying to make money at the same time.
 Would you yell at an artist for trying to sell their art, instead of giving it away to people?
Submit / report to RIOT please.

Hey guys, if you're low elo and read this, don't run that setup, it'll do you good, it doesn't work and will probably never work.
You're welcome!
I've seen this before and it was because I had a custom skin installed and the game patched.
 After patching it made the custom skin character show blue and would crash.
 Just run a repair of your client, it will fix it.
How could you still say that TSM was luckier then.
.
Yeah even unluckier than a team who had their coach banned from going and their jungler banned for half of groups.
Read it again.
 Pretty clear.
 Everything to do with Riot's response to the issue, no comment on Chroma itself.
 Easy to dismiss as an "angry comment" when you disagree and don't actually read, eh?
Also, pretty good evidence that the situation Riot's fostered here is ridiculous.
I dont know if you read the comments, but it's kind of sad.
 One's just stating : no physic activity -> not a sport.
It's like the guy didn't read the article.
That was such bs.
 I remember back in the day I got some NX for my birthday and bought a bomb ass outfit, but then it expired one day.
 I was pissed
What an original and refreshing thread!
Noxiak reportedly denied tryouts with EL and went with Giants.
I understand that.
 The point is it's a no cost toggle on auto amplifier.
 This could be a passive on a real ability that takes a brain cell to use.
If you don't own the skin/champion then the price is included - much like every other bundle.
One of them hijacked the twitter account and was posting pictures of a (streamer?

Wow, that's a lot of new skins.
 And they're all awful.
Especially the SSW skins.
 Twitch and Rengar are two of the worst skins Riot's ever produced.
I want a white one so I can be Cum-Bubble Zac when I do my /joke
Plot Twist : We coach Rekkles
OP is trying to push his opinion on people while trying to look neutral.
Lol at worst it is calling Zion a backwards version of Flame.
 Bizarro Superman actually overpowers superman its just that superman is smarter.
 So Thorin could be saying that zion has more "potential" than Flame its just that NA is too backwards and zion is just a product of that.
Or maybe Thorin is just making a superman analogy for the lulz.
Only Pobelter.
"Silver player" ha, i think i have more elo than you, in fact, i dont play lee sin or zed because i hate op champs, and yes, they are so easy everyone picks em and zed is 100% banned every game.
 Yeah, thats not easy and op.
This is why I do not like this community.
 You were outraged that Riot would dare sell recolored skins, not less than a week ago.
 Now it's like "I'll buy it anyways if you are still going to do it anyways" .
 How quickly can our minds forget?
Everything cosmetic should be paid for.
.
ok I can get on with it, but until all champions are free to play then LoL is not free to play.
I can't remember who was discussing it but there was talk of Izuna (?
) a lightning assassin with a storm like teleport.
Yeah the Lucian pack is nice!
 I bought it too.
Lol that's really funny calling this game f2p and balancing is the nothing out of the ordinary.
Thresh floats with homegaurds :)
zac's flobbernoggins are hard cause he is too flubbery.
 but i still love his gooperonis
Yea happened to me few times, annoying as sht, I even flashed once by mistake xD
Or if you aren't a complete autist just go on one of the many sites that provide that information for you.
 Another really stupid idea.
Not sure why you would want something that would bring so much shame to you anyway.
And it's not like they used to be beasts in the 2v2 or anything.
 FNC even relying on Rekkles late S4 to carry games .
The goldfish memory of this sub will always be amazing.
Would be awesome.
she's definitely outdated-feeling.
 That buff to her passive kinda hurt her early game (because it now scales off AP instead of flat amounts).
 Not being able to clear the back line is a big issue.
 She doesnt have anything she truly is the best or top-tier at.
If you are a good lissandra player riven is kinda useless against her the first 15-20 minutes.
 Liss Q hurts and slows her so she is too slow to get in aa range and if she dashes just W and she is rooted in place.
 If she ults you do as well and E away or fight back depending on your damage on her.
To turn it into a victory your teamfights are most important an you have to make sure she doesnt get fed from your teammates ;)
all the black people rioting like in baltimore.
.
 yeah pretty racist lol.
I've been very upfront here that I'm in severe sleep dep mode, and I my brain is skipping frames like my FPS just dropped to 5.

Sounds like a pricing/currency problem needs to be solved first.
Something basic like garen, ashe, annie.
 I believe most of the cheap champs are pretty easy to understand.
Well king rammus is bowser.
 I'm no lawyer but I think they could.
Check out /r/Chromarequest some guy there made it
She already has a pretty good late game, but it's interesting to see if she will become a hypercarry like Jinx or Kogmaw.

Most 450 or 1350 IP champions are generally easy to use and can still be effective.
 Annie is straightforward, teaches how to CS (with her q refunding mana) and you can just spam everything on one target to be effective and 100-0 them.

Pulsefire Ez makes it look like I deal less damage, no idea why but it just feels like it.
you're making a lot of assumptions, primarily that I consider faker to be one of the two best midlaners in the world.
Kur0, wellness, Pawn, and Rookie have all been incredibly more impressive.
 But yeah, just cause I have skt flair I must blindly believe faker is the best.
The point remains The difference between goodbut-not-great midlaners and the top 3 in the world is an ocean.
I voted with my wallet.
 And I bought some Chromas, cause Im tired of these threads lol.
Over pretty much the entire split, Kiwi has been one of the most dominant support laners, their team overall seemed to have no plan on post-lane.
I don't think he's top tier, but I think he's easily mid-tier with Fufu/Adrian, who are very similarly strong at a specific style of play but not very versatile.
i am actually quite interested in what you are telling me and you dont have to make me feel better my friend :)
also i dont want to convince you that my opinion is the right one.
 just what i see here around
rengar has dreads since release they just have another color
Double seems to always do at least ok in playoffs but aphro n Link seem to struggle I honestly really like both players and if they can get past this playoff performance hump i think we will see them at worlds
They don't.

 Chess skill can be acquired; physique cannot.
 It just happens that gaming and chess are centered around a mental qualification, while sports (and modeling) are centered around a physical one.
 It's much harder to overcome one of these obstacles than the other.

 Im positive I read on both an article AND on tsitter that they asked to contract him and he said he wanted a full time place.
 Unless you mean a streamer contract, in which case I dint care - they are irrelevant for professional play
someone has probably made a custom skin
Who?
that was juggarmaw not ap kog you don't need Lulu or Janna for it which is kind of obvious since TSM played neither with their Kog

Different people have different tastes, not the same taste.

This is, and always has been, a visual bug.
 Try it out in a custom and quickly realize you are not getting 600 gold.
Yeah, its better
Zed just does everything better.
EDIT If you enjoy playing talon you should try diana.

Not sure why he would leave C9T for anything other than a top team, since C9T team are looking really good and clg isn't known for its management.

Basically there is a delay before the ring does damage, and if they try to run Jarvan can ult them on the edge, forcing them to take an insane amount of True Damage.
 You can also ult from a distance to set up the ring inside Jarvan's ult, the delay is still there for damage but they can't escape w/o flashing or using a dash.
 On any immobile targets you basically wreck.
 And since Ashe is basically in EVERY game right now, it's good.
Such as?
I'm a little salty as when I did the survey I some how thought I would be able to 'buy three chromes for XRP' where it's really buying 6 hotdogs and 10 buns.
Wich specs does it have?
 I just saw one with an i3 1.
90ghz - 8gb ram - intel hd 4400.
 If those are the specs you should be fine in fps.
About the heat thing i don't know.
imo it's going to get high temperature if you play 4 hs non stop~~.
You can install the game and test it, it's not going to damage your computer, good luck!
Really, he beat Alex last night.
 and apparently did very well against Bjergsen in his C9 tryouts.
ayy only acknowledging evidence that suits your theory ayy
Dexter is okay, jwaow is good, froggen is very good, as is tabzz, nyph just okay, this looks like a 4-5th place type team to me.
 Odd that they didn't trial noxiak or any other jungles.

 Actually sounds like a good suggestion.
Main reason it won't happen.
I'd laugh so much if Kog's passive yelled "Allahu Akbar" before dying
I just want to see aphromoos body pillow again
didn't think about it that way, sounds pretty good.
 Sounds better for my wallet in the long run when they release more of these
Your argument about no one recruiting NA players is pretty pointless.
 CN and KR don't need NA players.
 They don't need EU players either.
 NA simply saves the EU players that have promise if a horrible fate of playing in EU games where everything is just a bloodbath with very limited strategy.
 And EU and NA being on the same level?
 Good joke man, maybe last season.
 One deluded EU fan boys even think EU could stand up to any other region.
I dunno, google dlift theory crafting.
 Anyone that you click will probably be sufficient evidence.
Edit: but on a serious note when they made the changes to adc itemization he predicted tristana would be bad, surprise she was probably the number one pick.
 Secondly why do you think tri was bad then?
 Just because doublelift said it?
 Even his explanation of why triforce is bad is dumb.
 Also dlift was relevant because half the video was mocking him being wrong.
no, the D
The best thing to do is sell base chromos for rp but skin chromos for ip, this way you get more sales on skins.
people dont want to buy a skin then later have to buy something else to make their skin more special
Skarner is the same champion as Volibear and Sejuani, but does less damage and doesn't actually scale with HP innately.
 He has a high winrate because his kit and role are meta, but either of the mentioned champions are better picks, and carry harder, earlier.
If you saw game 5 between C9 and team liquid, lemonnations straight up walks up against iwd and quas and proceeds to 1v2 them.
 No other support can do that at level 1

Keith performed remarkably well in the LCS where Steelback was mediocre at best where Rekkles even on a worse team looked better on an individual basis.
 It is not like Rekkles was the reason that Alliance underperformed so gravely
lol you don't have to buy it and doing so does not disadvantage you in any way in game.
 It's just providing people different options
I do not agree with that.
 Crit chance is actually pretty hard to get and cost a lot of money.
Also it would be random.
.
 so you need to actualy last hit AND crit to get the 4 gold bonus.
 Also some champion have it build in in their kit, (i.
g.
 : twiste fate, ashe), and it's not even close to be op, also they have it on every last hit.
That why I don't think it's actually a HUGE advantage but more like a small neith thing.
Yep, I will be voting by buying them because they are sweet as hell and for a good price.
cool story bro tell it again
The laws of physics apply just as much to video games as they do to real sports.
 That's a really strange things bring up.
Also sports do change rules similarly to patches.
 You happened to mention Tom Brady, someone who actually had a rule changed essentially by an incident he was involved in.
Esports have some level of physical requirements, they're just a much smaller sub set of requirements.
 Calling them athletes is doing a disservice to those who have put in the work to run 4.
16 40s and stuff but to act as though LOL Pros don't also put in work to hone skills and physical acumen us unfair.
Great.
 ARAM is a constant fight, I'd much rather have a unique summoner spell that is usable all the time than one I can only use once every few minutes.
Cooldown could get increased a little, but honestly I love how hectic it makes the game, and how many champs are now viable because of it.
I think if you were an expert at a certain topic or specialized in a certain area, you would be much more interesting.
 Your casting isn't bad but nothing you say or do is unique/spectacular.
This is what I've heard (unsure of the validity): Apparently all they are doing for chromas right now is editing the hex code for the colour.
 Zac's model isn't programmed the same way as any of the other models as it's a very dynamic model (it's constantly resizing and stretching) so it's no as simple in his code to just change a hex value on a body part.
OK

Nevermind that most people only want one.
The history of fnatic?
 Fnatic had been pretty much the only professional team Rekkles had ties to since the times of IPL5.
 Last seasons end was unfortunate, but I can't fault Rekkles for jumping what looks like a sinking ship.
Realistically fnatic could have also just flopped completely and that seemed more likely considering they basically build the roster from scratch.
Also I think you can hardly deny that Rekkles is just the better player with a similar playstyle.
 Steelback just looked mediocre where Rekkles looked great in the past
the thing that makes me laugh most about this article, besides the fact that it was clearly rushed, poorly written, and made based on the notion that the community should just believe it because it was written, without a single mention of a possible source (ok ok thats a lot i know)
is that Fnatic in its current state is a team that functions with top/mid carries.
 Huni and Febiven are the damage dealers of this team and thats what makes someone like Steelback the perfect supporting actor.
 He doesn't demand gold, but he uses what he has to his advantage, he cleans up kills, takes towers, uses his champions effectively; all things that Rekkles simply didn't do this year.
 He's an ADC that demands gold but doesn't use what he receives to the benefit on his team, which is why they sat at 7th this spring.
Maybe i'll eat my words if this becomes a reality, but with the way Rekkles left the organization, and the way Fnatic has been functioning as a team the past few months, this is a long shot, and mostly a bait piece of 'reporting'
nothing change still trash

Hey, Your CLG is showing.
that was just one example, other examples may just be people playing around like when you know the game is like in the bag, and you fuck with each other a little (like trying to steal camps or something), little things like that are technically classified as trolling, but they are not meant to be harmful and negative
I love playing basketball, and although I've been playing for years now, I'm not very good BUT I can see and know how plays are unfolding - I recognize elevator doors before they are being set, i can tell when players are going to pull up to create a 2 for 1, how defenses are specifically attacking a certain PnR compared to another.
 That being said, I am sure that the talent/skill gap between myself and a world superstar like LeBron James or Stephen Curry is smaller than the talent/skill gap between myself and a celebrated LoL pro like Faker.
 And there's no chance in hell I could even reach 1% of LBJ's level so.
 Yeah, the LoL pros are just really fucking good.
This is how that Nocturne story started.
I've had my Velocity icon on since the day it came out.
 Never used a different one.
 Ain't no way I'm changing that shit.
dat 1st pic is gay af
literally a wave clear bot
Do you say that Steelback is as close in mechanical skill to Rekkles as Tabbz was?
 I felt that change was more due to internal stuff not going as well on alliance
thanks for pointing that out so people dont feel "guilty" or cheated on about something where emotions shouldnt be involved
riot offers a service and they get paid for what they offer 
Red chroma for ezreal pls.
Pob was also going to tear up NA.

Honestly I would love 3 "free" basic skin recolors to go along with any of the higher tier skins.
 I dont like that i basically have to choose between 1 good skin or 2 *ok* skins and a recolor for some champions
The game no longer exists in my match history!
 I can just disregard it now :)

What a mistake RIP FNATIC.
hype :?
Oh so that's what that was about.
 My brother tells me it was because I was talking too much and was toxic.
The gold items are insanely good for allowing you to upkeep gold income in the event you have to constantly buy and place pink wards, as well as if you are behind and have not hit late-game yet when you are wielding 20k+ gold earned.
diamond 5 is also pretty bad because everyone is salty about lp gains
When you're in game you can fix this by going to Hotkeys and rebinding them to "quick-cast with indicators.
" 
I just bought a pack.
 Is there any reason in particular that I can't see them in Team Builder?
Yes, Korea is better right now.
 But that doesn't mean they will be forever.
 That doesn't mean Froggen, who obviously is taking the challenge of creating a world class team without any Koreans can't be successful.

This is complete bullshit.
 The whole fuss about Chroma skins is not because they don't look pretty, but because they require zero effort to make.
 People are mad because you keep spouting your "cost to make in comparison to the price" bullshit all around and then come out with this.
 This is the biggest cash grab move Riot has ever made, and as with all companies before you we know that it's only going to go downhill from here.
Also iirc Freeze said that he is very likely staying in EU.
A red Kennen chroma would be the shit.
 Have been waiting for that for so long.
Yeah, no it didn't.
/s
That might be because Darius scale better with defensive stats than health and also that nobody plays him enough to figure out what's decent on him.
 And really the build path and the cost of the item is pretty bad.
Yeah wtf did the stun not apply?
 Is that a bug?
/r/outside is leaking
You forgot to sign into your other account lollol
Forgiven isn't upgrade for any top 3 team in NA/EU LCS.
 Sorry, while good players, his champ pool is weak.
 Lack of be able to play Corki, Kog, sivir was a problem for SK.
 This make so comp are limited because of his weaken.
Not be able to play corki make harder for team to make comp with AD mid, need that extra magic damage from corki.
Not play strongest team fight ADC of sivir really hurt most of comp that are played.
KoG is very nice champ with tank heavy meta.
When he learn to pick up and play a few more champ than maybe top ADC.
Look, Talon and Zed are my favourite two mid laners.
 Zed is a lot stronger all round.
 Talon on the other hand has to play safe till 6 and all in, he has hardly any poke (his w uses heaps of mana) and can be bullied hard in lane by champs like ziggs.
 If Talon can roam and get a kill early his snowball is nearlly unstoppable.
 If he gets destroyed early, its very hard to come back.
 In my opinion, playing Talon is a bit of a gamble in a way.
 Hope this helps.

I love DL but it could just be him/link
I'm still going to buy them.
 They are actually worth RP to me.
 They should introduce golden/diamond skins for our champions as mastery rewards, like in SMITE.
 But that won't happen, obviously.
That makes more sense to me now

I might be.

Troll account is troll
The last game i played i tryed it out and i had my core build already set.
 Relic, Sight, Boots, Righteous Glory and Randuin's.
 So slamming in a Cinderhulk still would be a no no?
 I could have built a sunfire cape.
 and recieved the 45 armor.
Idk im just confused.
 I read somewhere that tanks were using Cinderhulk i tryed it out and i felt like i could stay longer and take more hit.
 but that also could have been to how the apposing team was building.
I think originally Rekkles was exceptional, and it may have just because he became disillusioned with the regime and motivation of the previous Fnatic squad, but he really didn't look all that good at the end.
People joke about him being off farming when Fnatic are ahead and looking to push, but it really happened.
 Hopefully for Fnatic it will be an improvement, and I hope that Rekkles' ego doesn't get in the way.
I forgot to mention that he did say that the fall back option if they can't find a competent mid lane shot caller was to allocate the responsbility to Meteos.

 Good thing we live in the universe where scrim results matter!

They never wanted to bench Hai, he left himself because of his wrist injury.
Horrendous for an ADC and more expensive.
 When you are going up against a tank with 200 armor and have to hit them with 6 instances of physical damage to get 5% less armor pen than a LW you cripply your damage.

Hopefully if you're playing Anivia and try to go on a magical journey, you should try to not LOSE YOUR WAAAAAAAAAAAY, YOUR MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND.

I hope it said "*A Summoner has been Slain*"
Hey remember that skin you said you'd gift me.
My mate and I are duo-queue partners, and I run ADC while he is top/ jg trundle.
 Trundle is incredibly broken, when built right, man.
 He has a 93% win rate with like 16 games played as trundle, and like a 6 KDA.
 Then again, perhaps my opinion is skewed by his performance; if you're a good player, you do well as the champion you're good at.

 Believe it or not but there is more in this world than Europe and the USA !
This just made my day.
It truly is strange.
 I know what you're supposed to do vs annie and I've been on both sides of seeing it executed correctly.
 I do know for a fact that I do lose the majority of the games where I'm against an annie mid and in all those loses she hard carried with multi kills in every fight.
See tanks really do screw with annie and her lack of range compared to other mages really hurts in a variety of ways as well.
 We also know that she goes roam happy once she has tibbers.
 No one ever seems to make use of this info until shes 5-0 and can blow up anyone she wants.
* The enemy team complaining about each other to my team is what I LIVE for.

 Only difference is that Rekkless is really strong mechanically.
